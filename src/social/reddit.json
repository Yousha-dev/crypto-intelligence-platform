    "title": "Do Kwon just got sentenced to 15 years for a $40 billion fraud while SBF got 25 years for an $11 billion fraud and the reason why is actually really intresting.",
    "selftext": "Kwons Terra-Luna collapse caused nearly four times more financial damage than FTX but he got 10 years less prison time. The judge called it fraud on an epic generational scale with hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. So why the lighter sentence?\n\nThe biggest difference was how they handled their cases. Kwon pleaded guilty in August and took responsibility. He wrote to the court saying he was responsible for the pain people went through and that he led the community astray in his hubris. He listened to hundreds of victim impact statements and apologized directly.\n\nSBF on the other hand went to trial and maintained his innocence throughout. He claimed FTX just had a liquidity crisis not actual fraud. The jury convicted him in about four hours. Judge Kaplan found that SBF committed perjury multiple times on the stand and called his testimony some of the most evasive he’d seen in decades. SBF also tried to tamper with witnesses before trial by messaging FTXs former general counsel.\n\nAnother huge factor is Kwon faces up to 40 additional years in South Korea after he finishes his US sentence. The judge explicitly considered this when deciding on 15 years. SBF doesnt have any foreign charges waiting so his 25 years is basically it unless his appeal succeeds.\n\nThe takeaway here is pretty clear – cooperation and actual remorse can massively reduce your sentence even if your fraud was way bigger. Going to trial and lying under oath will get you hammered regardless of the dollar amounts involved.",

    "selftext": "one thing i don’t think people fully get about crypto taxes is how “year by year” it really is. the tax office doesn’t look at your whole life and say “overall you’re flat so we’re good.” they look at 2021, 2022, 2023 separately and charge or credit you per year.\n\nso say in 2021 you traded like crazy, locked in big gains, and actually sold to usdt or fiat. on paper you made, idk, 50k. in many countries (like the us for example) you owe tax on that 50k for that year. then 2022 hits, market dies, your bags go -80%. emotionally you feel “i lost it all back” but legally 2021 is still a profit year and 2022 is a loss year. they don’t auto cancel.\n\nyou can usually use losses to offset gains in the same year and then carry extra losses forward, but you can’t go back in time and apply 2022 losses to your 2021 tax bill. that’s why people feel like their “2021 bull” is still haunting them years later. the tax system remembered the win and only slowly lets you use the later losses.\n\ntiming also matters a lot. if you dumped losers before 31 december 2021 you might have reduced that 50k taxable gain a ton. if you waited until january 2022, too late, now it’s a new year and a new bucket.\n\ncurious if anyone here actually did proper tax loss harvesting during the bull or if you just realised all this later like “oh yeah… i was supposed to think about that.”",

My stepdad has recently got interested in investing but he’s also 50 something and barely can operate his mobile fidelity app. Is there any reputable systems for possibly purchasing a crypto gift card? Or like voucher? Preferably Bitcoin or Ether. Basically I need the simplest way to wrap up and hand him some accessible crypto as a Christmas gift to further push him into investing aside from me literally sending him some via coin base because I feel like that’s kind of tacky but hey what do I know, wow have I still not hit 500 characters? Of wait I just haven’t picked a flair sorry if you read this. \n\nThanks yall happy holidays ",

    "selftext": "Sorry for the long post. Move along if not interested.\n\nI was involved in crypto from 2020-2022ish. Did the research, drank the metaphorical cool-aid. Cryptocurrency resonated with me due to a love of finance, technology and decentralization independence. Not to mention the slew of problems materializing and present in traditional fiat finance.\n\nI made some money, and thought I would be a forever holder. But then got caught up in the Celsius and BlockFi bankruptcies. Eventually leading to the sale of all of my cryptocurrency due to the belief that the layman would never be savvy enough to store their own keys, and centralized layer 2 was just reinventing the traditional finance system, but with less consumer protections.\n\nFast forward to today, a hobby miner caught my interest and reignited my passion for crypto.\n\nSo here I am, trying to convince myself to get back into cryptocurrency. However, upon further research, the foundation of crypto seems to have changed.\n\nPrimarily my concerns are the following:\n\n1.\t⁠The upcoming security budget problem as the Bitcoin halving continues to make mining less profitable.\n\n2.\t⁠MSTR and the flywheel leverage default risk.\n\n3.\t⁠Tether minting unverified stablecoins that prop up the crypto market. (this one existed when I was in crypto prior also)\n\nHow are all of you navigating these risks? Like I said, I WANT to be involved, because i recognize the value of a decentralized network. But the above very real potential downsides make me nervous with FUD.\n\nThanks for reading the whole post! Love to hear your thoughts",

I lead Web3 projects and also serve in ministry, and over the last few years I’ve been obsessed with one question:\n\n**“What would a modern Acts 2 look like and how to create it?”**\n\nThat led me to explore things like:  \n– Time Dollar Banking (treating hours of service as currency)  \n– Using blockchain for transparent church finances  \n– DAOs for benevolence funds & community decision-making  \n– How to *avoid* speculation/hype while still engaging the tech\n\nI just released a book pulling a lot of this together, but I’m not here to hard sell it. I’d rather be useful.\n\nSo if you’re a:  \n– Pastor / church leader wondering if any of this is legit  \n– Believer who’s crypto-curious or skeptical  \n– Web3 person wondering if faith communities can be real use cases\n\n…ask me anything. I’m happy to talk about:  \n– Theology concerns (money, usury, stewardship, etc.)  \n– Practical setups (wallets, transparency, time banks)  \n– Pitfalls (scams, bad incentives, church hurt 2.0)\n\nI’ll drop the book link in a comment for anyone who wants it, but feel no obligation. I mainly want this convo to be helpful and grounded.",

    "selftext": "Summary: 12/10/25\n\nMarket Cap: 3.3 Trillion ($3,300,000,000,000)\n\nBitcoin $92K - ($92,000)\nEthereum $3.3K - ($3,300)\n\n\nI wanted to know if anyone had collected the same data in the previous few weeks. I might be a little off, and the data might be outdated and inconclusive.\nIs sharing it with the community safe? I'm taking a risk, but this is what I've read and learned. Please correct me if I'm mistaken.\n\n\n\n1.    The Federal Reserve Rate Cut: (-.25%) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, December 10, 2025, by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorter-term Treasury securities.\n\nKey Decisions and Implications:\n\n⦁    Interest Rate Cut: This is the third consecutive quarter-point rate cut this year. This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy, though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns.\n\n⦁    Bond Purchases (Balance Sheet Policy): The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves. This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening (QT), meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet. This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system, which were showing signs of stress in the repo (repurchase agreement) market.\n\n\nPerspective: BULLISH 🙂\n\n⦁    Down -25% (75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025)\n⦁    Short term treasuries, quantitative tightening\n⦁    Jerome Powell is terminated (FOMC Chairman)\n\n2. Artificial Intelligence:\n\n\nNvidia swinging (November) $195 -> $170 -> $183 today\n\n⦁    AI companies (TOP 7) are being challenged by smaller competitors\n⦁    Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor\n⦁    Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers\n⦁    No quantum computing technology to break encryption coding\n\n\nRandom Bulls Events:\n\n⦁    Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30% recently in crypto\n⦁    Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently. New players are IE. (JPMorgan, Vanguard, Schwab, Morgan Stanley.)\n⦁    Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95%\n\n\nRandom Bears Events:\n\n⦁    Government - Shutdown 43 days - influenced the market heavily in all aspects\n⦁    Jobs - No November or December job reports or accuracy\n⦁    Unemployment - Raised over the past two years\n⦁    Tariffs - Taxing everyone\n\n\nRandom Thoughts:\n\nBitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service. There are 21,000,000 coins and 95% have been mined. An unknown number of coins have been lost forever.\n\nImagine there are 8,200,000,000 (8.2 billion) humans on earth today.\n\n1 of 4 are Chinese. (25% people on EARTH) 2,000,000,000 (2.0 billion) Chinese.\n\nPut this into perspective China are not pro crypto, nor is it legal since its ban in 2021. Meaning, in China you can be literally hanged, if not imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto. Yet, you can mine in China, as they are #3 in the world in this field.\n\nThe crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly, not 2 billion dollars. This number is trillions. Possibly more than gold.\n\nIt's almost like they are the little kid who can't play with the big kids when playing sports. They are hindered by the government's choices for freedom of investments.",

It’s basically being converted for them and all this is is marketing for Mastercard or Visa.\n\nIt’s not adoption, the merchant isn’t actively accepting any Bitcoin or ETH.

    "selftext": "ETH managed to break above the $3,200 and $3,250 resistance levels that were holding it back. The price even pushed past $3,350 and touched a high of $3,396 before consolidating. Right now its trading above $3,200 and showing strong momentum with a bullish trendline forming around the $3,210 support level.\n\nThe technical setup looks pretty solid. If ETH can break above the $3,380 resistance it could target $3,420 next and possibly even $3,500 to $3,550 in the near term. The momentum indicators are flipping bullish with the MACD gaining strength and RSI above 50 which usually signals more upside potential.\n\nWhats intresting is Ethereum is outperforming btc right now. While BTC struggles around $92k, ETH is showing relative strength which could mean we're seeing a rotation into alts or specifically into Ethereum based on fundamentals or technical breakouts.\n\nHowever theres still risk here. If ETH fails to clear the $3,380 level it could pull back to support at $3,250 or even $3,210. A break below $3,210 would be concerning and might send it back toward $3,150 or lower.\n\nThe consolidation after the initial pump is actually healthy. It shows buyers are absorbing supply at these levels rather than just a quick pump and dump. The question is whether buyers have enough strength to push through the next resistance zone.\n\nETH dominance has also been ticking up on the charts lately, which kind of supports the idea of a short term momentum shift away from Bitcoin, at least for now.",

Most of your questions should be answered by the resources below but if you have additional questions feel free to ask them in the comments.  \n\nIt all started with the release of **[Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)** however that will probably go over the head of most readers so we recommend the following articles/books/videos as a good starting point for understanding how Bitcoin works and a little about its long term potential:\n\n* [Article: The Bullish Case for Bitcoin](https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1)\n* [Book: The Bitcoin Standard](https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861) - or [download a free copy here](http://cryptache.ro/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/The-Bitcoin-Standard-The-Decentralized-Alternative-to-Central-Banking-PDF-Room.pdf)\n* [Video 1: An introduction to Bitcoin - Wences Casares](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAFKJVLNVQA)\n* [Video 2: The Stories We Tell About Money - Andreas Antonopoulos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONvg9SbauMg)\n* [Video 3: The Bitcoin Standard - Saifdean Ammous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zbm772vF-5M&t=286s) \n* [Video 4: Bitcoin 101 - Balaji Srinivasan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIxwTx7o_B4)\n\nSome other great educational resources include;\n\n* The [Satoshi Nakamoto Institute](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/) (check them out!)  \n* Swan [Bitcoin Canon](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/canon/)\n* Michael Saylor's [Hope.com](https://hope.com/) and [\"Bitcoin for Everybody\"'](https://learn.saylor.org/course/view.php?id=468) course\n* Bitcoinfo.org [resource page](https://bitcoinfo.org/bitcoin.html)\n* Gigi's [resource page](https://bitcoin-resources.com/#bitcoin-non-technical)\n* James D'Angelo's [Bitcoin 101 Blackboard series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhe61JaNFLU&list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q&index=7&t=0s)\n* Parker Lewis's [Gradually Then Suddenly series](https://unchained.com/blog/category/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* Some Bitcoin statistics can be found here ([1](https://www.lookintobitcoin.com/), [2](https://data.bitcoinity.org/bitcoin/hashrate/6m?c=m&g=15&r=week&t=a), [3](https://bitcoinvisuals.com/), [4](https://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/dashboard/), [5](https://studio.glassnode.com/workbench/btc-price-performance-since-halving), [6](https://augmentedcoin.io/btc), [7](https://nakamotoportfolio.com/nakamoto/start), [8](https://bitcointreasuries.net/), [9](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#BTC,all,weight)).\n* A Reading List of [Advanced Bitcoin Books](https://new.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1c5fjhn/advanced_bitcoin_reading_list_curriculum_in_order/)  \n* The statewide [Bitcoin strategic reserve race](https://bitcoinlaws.io/reserve-race)\n\nIf you are technically or academically inclined check out;\n\n* Developer resources ([1](https://developer.bitcoin.org/), [2](https://spiral.xyz/#projects)) \n* [Peer-reviewed research papers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg)\n* Course lectures from both [MIT](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/15-s12-blockchain-and-money-fall-2018/) and [Princeton](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7qynvj/dont_panic_just_learn_sixty_free_lectures_from/) \n*  Future [protocol improvements](http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/2018-01-24-rusty-russell-future-bitcoin-tech-directions/) and [scaling resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/56nnd8/the_scaling_bitcoin_website_is_awesome_videos/).  \n\nMicroStrategy's [Bitcoin for Corporations](https://www.microstrategy.com/en/resources/events/world-2021/bitcoin-summit?CID=7014W0000014yhJQAQ) is an excellent open source series on corporate legal and financial Bitcoin integration.\n\nYou can also see the number of times Bitcoin was [declared dead by the media](https://99bitcoins.com/obituary-stats) (LOL!)\n\n## Key properties of Bitcoin\n\n* **Limited Supply** - There will only ever be a [maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoins created](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/10h04a6/this_is_how_we_know_theres_only_21_million_bitcoin/) and they are issued in a predictable fashion per the [inflation schedule](https://bashco.github.io/Bitcoin_Monetary_Inflation/).  Once they are all issued Bitcoin will be truly deflationary.  The [halving countdown](http://bitcoinblockhalf.com/) tells you approximately how much time until the next block reward halving.\n* **Open source** - Bitcoin code is fully auditable.  You can read and contribute to the [source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) yourself.\n* **Accountable** - The public ledger is transparent, all transactions are [seen by everyone](https://blockstream.info/).\n* **Decentralized** - Bitcoin is globally distributed across thousands of nodes with no single point of failure and as such can't be shut down similar to how [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) works.  You can even [run a node on a Raspberry Pi](https://getumbrel.com/).  \n* **Censorship resistant** - No one can prevent you from interacting with the Bitcoin network and no one can censor, alter or block transactions that they disagree with, see [Operation Chokepoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Choke_Point).\n* **Push system** - There are [no chargebacks](https://gendal.me/2013/10/21/lessons-from-bitcoin-push-versus-pull/) in Bitcoin because only the person who owns the address where the bitcoin resides has the authority to move them.\n* **Borderless** - No country can stop it from going in/out, even in areas currently unserved by traditional banking as the ledger is [globally distributed](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/).\n* **Trustless** - Bitcoin solved the [Byzantine's Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) which means nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work.\n* **Pseudonymous** - No need to [expose personal information](https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/anonymity/) when purchasing with cash or transacting. \n* **Secure** - Blocks and transactions are cryptographically secured (using hashes and signatures) and can’t be [brute forced](http://i.imgur.com/fYFBsqp.jpg) or confiscated with proper key management such as hardware wallets.\n* **Programmable** - Individual units of bitcoin can be [programmed to transfer](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script) based on certain criteria being met\n* **Divisible** - Each bitcoin can be [divided down to 8 decimals](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Satoshi_(unit\\)), which means you don't have to worry about buying an entire bitcoin. \n* **Nearly instant** - From a few seconds on the Lightning Network to a [few minutes](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/median-confirmation-time) on-chain depending on need for confirmations.  Transactions are irreversible by normal users after one confirmation and irreversible by anyone (including miners) after 6 confirmations. \n* **Peer-to-peer** - No intermediaries taking a cut, no need for [trusted third parties](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/trusted-third-parties/).\n* **Designed Money** - Bitcoin was created to fit all the [fundamental properties of money](https://imgur.com/a/5w3l2A6) better than gold or fiat.\n* **Portable** - Bitcoin are digital so they are easier to move than cash or gold.  They can be transported by simply carrying a seed (a string of 12 to 24 words) on a device or by [memorizing it for wallet recovery](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Brainwallet) (while cool, memorizing is generally not recommended due to potential for forgetting the seed and the potential for insecure key generation by inexperienced users.  Hardware wallets are the preferred method for most users for their ease of use and additional security).\n* **Low fee scaling** - Most wallets calculate on chain fees automatically but you can view [fee estimates](https://river.com/learn/how-bitcoin-fees-work/) and [mempool activity](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,2w) if you want to set your fee manually.  On chain fees may rise occasionally due to network demand, however instant micropayments that do not require confirmations are happening via the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network/), an open source second layer payment protocol built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. The Lightning Network enables Bitcoin users to instantly send and receive bitcoin with fees so low that they are negligible.\n* **Scalable** - While the protocol is still being optimized for [increased transaction capacity](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability), blockchains do not scale very well, so most transaction volume is expected to occur on Layer 2 networks built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n## Where can I buy bitcoin?\n\n[Bitcoin.org](https://bitcoin.org/en/buy) and [BuyBitcoinWorldwide.com](https://www.buybitcoinworldwide.com/) are helpful sites for beginners.  You can buy or sell any amount of bitcoin (even just a few dollars worth) and there are several easy methods to purchase bitcoin with cash, credit card or bank transfer.  Some of the more popular places to buy bitcoin are listed below.\n\n* [Strike](https://strike.me/)\n* [Cash App](https://cash.app/)\n* [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/)\n* [River Financial](https://river.com/)\n* [Bull Bitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/) \n* [Bitcoin Well](https://bitcoinwell.com/) \n* [Relai](https://relai.app/)\n* [LibertyX](https://libertyx.com/)\n* [CoinCorner](https://www.coincorner.com/)\n* [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) (decentralized & P2P)\n* [HodlHodl](https://hodlhodl.com/?filters%5Bcurrency_code%5D=USD) (P2P)\n* [List of peer-to-peer exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/)\n* [Debifi](https://debifi.com/) (non-custodial lending)\n\nYou can also purchase in cash with [local ATMs](http://coinatmradar.com/). If you would like your paycheck automatically converted to bitcoin try [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/).  \n\n**Note:** Bitcoin are valued at whatever [market price](https://aggr.trade/1m1h) people are willing to pay for them in balancing act of supply vs demand. Unlike traditional markets, bitcoin markets operate 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. \n\n## Securing your bitcoin\n\nWith Bitcoin you can **\"Be your own bank\"** and personally secure your bitcoin **OR** you can use third party companies aka **\"Bitcoin banks\"** which will hold your bitcoin for you.\n\n* If you prefer to **\"Be your own bank\"** and have direct control over your coins without having to use a trusted third party, then you will need to create your own wallet and keep it secure. If you want easy and secure storage without having to learn best computer security practices, then a hardware wallet such as a [BitBox02](https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/),  [Trezor](https://www.trezor.io/), [ColdCard](https://coldcardwallet.com/), or [Blockstream Jade](https://blockstream.com/jade/) is recommended. You can even build your own open source hardware wallets called a [SeedSigner](https://seedsigner.com/) or [Krux](https://selfcustody.github.io/krux/).\n\n* If you cannot afford a hardware wallet there are many [software wallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet) options to choose from depending on your use case.  Mobile wallets like [BlueWallet](https://bluewallet.io/) are generally more secure than desktop wallets.  Beware of fake mobile wallets and check reviews from reputable Bitcoin websites.  Avoid paper wallets or brain wallets.\n\n* If you prefer to work with third party **\"Bitcoin banks\"** to set up a collaborative custody arrangement, try [Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/) but be aware that any third party you use exposes you to third party risk.  There is a saying in the community, **\"Not your keys, not your coins\"**. \n\n**Note: For increased security, use Two Factor Authentication (2FA) everywhere it is offered, including email!** \n\n2FA requires a second confirmation code or a physical security key to access your account making it much harder for thieves to gain access.  Google Authenticator and Authy are the two most popular 2FA services, download links are below.  Make sure you create backups of your 2FA codes.\n\n**Avoid using your cell number for 2FA.**  Hackers have been using a technique called \"SIM swapping\" to impersonate users and steal bitcoin off exchanges.\n\nGoogle Auth | Authy | OTP Auth \n--------------|--------|------------\n[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy&hl=en) | N/A \n[iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) | [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authy/id494168017) | [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/otp-auth/id659877384) | \n\nPhysical security keys (FIDO U2F) offer stronger security than Google Auth / Authy and other TOTP-based apps, because the secret code never leaves the device and it uses bi-directional authentication so it prevents phishing. If you lose the device though, you could lose access to your account, so always use 2 or more security keys with a given account so you have backups. See [Yubikey](https://yubikey.com/) or [Titan](https://cloud.google.com/titan-security-key) to purchase security keys.\n\n## Running Bitcoin\n\nYou can run [Bitcoin node](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/18736/what-is-a-bitcoin-node) software by downloading and installing [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) or other node software you have vetted. \n\nIt is a best practice to verify these Bitcoin node programs you download by [checking their hashes and signatures](https://youtu.be/U0I-ImS_r8o?si=qa_gRyGPuRZq5acM). \n\nDon't Trust, Verify.\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases\n* https://bitcoincore.org\n* https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/\n\nA verified Bitcoin node running on your own hardware is your sovereign gateway to the Bitcoin network. They can be used alongside open source software [wallets](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet) to send and receive Bitcoin securely. By running your own Bitcoin node, you enforce the Bitcoin ruleset, can verify transactions without trusted 3rd party middlemen, improve your Bitcoin privacy, obtain independence with local access to blockchain data, and help bolster the robustness of the Bitcoin network. By running a Bitcoin node, you are verifying that Bitcoin is Bitcoin for yourself. For more details on running a Bitcoin node see [this article](https://unchained.com/blog/why-run-bitcoin-node/). \n\nFor wallets used alongside your Bitcoin node: If your Bitcoin wallet software is fully [open source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/80111/is-bitcoin-completely-open-source/80115#80115) and Bitcoin-only, then it is probably a decent wallet. Some popular examples include [sparrow wallet](https://sparrowwallet.com/) and [electrum wallet](https://electrum.org/), both of which you can connect to your own locally run Bitcoin node, and use with most Bitcoin Hardware Wallets.\n\n## Watch out for scams\n\nAs mentioned above, Bitcoin is decentralized, which by definition means there is no official website or Twitter handle or spokesperson or CEO. However, all money attracts thieves. This combination unfortunately results in scammers running official sounding names or pretending to be an authority on YouTube or social media. Many scammers throughout the years have claimed to be the inventor of Bitcoin. Websites like bitcoin(dot)com and the r / btc subreddit are active scams.  Almost all altcoins are marketed heavily with big promises but are really just designed to separate you from your bitcoin.  So be careful: any resource, including all linked in this document, may in the future turn evil.  As they say in our community, **\"Don't trust, verify\"**. \n\n* Avoid using ad-based search engines like Google or Yahoo: ads are shown based on how much the advertiser bids, and scammers can easily outbid legitimate providers for ad space, since immoral ways of earning money are far more lucrative than moral ways.  Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead, which has no ads, and never tracks you as well.\n* Ignore private messages offering services.\n* **Never enter your seed words in a website of any kind.** Hardware wallets will recover by displaying possible seed words on their own interface, never on a website.\n* **Always check addresses on your hardware wallet before sending or receiving.**  Some malware has been known to replace addresses in your web browser or that you copy-and-paste.\n* Avoid clicking on links like that look like links, such as [https://www.google.com/](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ybW48rKBME), without first hovering over it and actually checking where they go to.  Just because a link is labelled with an HTTPS address does not mean it actually sends you to that address.  It is trivial for someone to comment a link on Reddit that looks like it will send you to one website when it actually sends you to another, and you might not notice the difference until a scammer has gotten all your money, or you have downloaded and installed software that steals your money.\n\n## Common Bitcoin Myths\nOften the same concerns arise about Bitcoin from newcomers.  Questions such as:\n\n* Will quantum computers break Bitcoin?\n* Will governments ban Bitcoin?\n* Is Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme?\n\nAll of these questions have been answered many times by a variety of people.  Here are some resources where you can see if your concern has been answered:\n\n* [Common Bitcoin Myths](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths)\n* [Gradually, Then Suddenly](https://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/series/gradually-then-suddenly/)\n* [Every Reason Bitcoin Will Not Fail](https://safehodl.github.io/failure/)\n* [The Best Articles Debunking Bitcoin FUD](https://endthefud.org/)\n* [Why Bitcoin is Not a Ponzi Scheme: Point by Point](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/why-bitcoin-is-not-a-ponzi-scheme-point-by-point/)\n\n## Where can I spend bitcoin?\n\nCheck out [Spendabit](https://spendabit.co/), [Bitcoin Directory](http://bitcoin.directory/shop), or [Coinmap](http://coinmap.org/) for a plethora of merchant options.

Newcomers are often advised to stay away from mining unless they are only interested in it as a hobby similar to [folding at home](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en).  If you want to learn more about mining you can read the [mining FAQ](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Faq#Mining). Still have mining questions?  The crew at /r/BitcoinMining would be happy to help you out. \n\nIf you want to contribute to the Bitcoin network by hosting the blockchain and propagating transactions there are many [great resources](https://raspibolt.org/) you can use to [run a full node](https://river.com/learn/how-to-run-a-bitcoin-node/).  You can view the global distribution of reachable Bitcoin nodes on [this webpage.](https://bitnodes.io/nodes/live-map/)\n\n## Earning bitcoin\n\nJust like any other form of money, you can also earn bitcoin by being paid to do a job.\n\nSite | Description\n---|---\n[WorkingForBitcoins](https://workingforbitcoins.com), [Bitwage](https://www.bitwage.com/for-individuals/), [Coinality](https://coinality.com/), [Bitgigs](http://bitgigs.com/), [/r/Jobs4Bitcoins](http://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins) | Freelancing\n[Lolli](https://www.lolli.com/) | Earn bitcoin when you shop online!\n\nYou can also earn bitcoin by participating as a market maker on [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket) by allowing users to perform CoinJoin transactions with your bitcoin for a small fee (requires you to already have some bitcoin).\n\n## Bitcoin-Related Projects\n\nThe following is a **short** list of ongoing projects that might be worth taking a look at if you are interested in current development in the Bitcoin space.  \n\nProject | Description\n---|---\n[Lightning Network](https://lightning.engineering/index.html)| Second layer scaling\n[Liquid](https://blockstream.com/liquid/) and [Rootstock](https://www.rsk.co/) | Sidechains\n[Hivemind](http://bitcoinhivemind.com) | Prediction markets\n[DropZone](https://github.com/17Q4MX2hmktmpuUKHFuoRmS5MfB5XPbhod/dropzone) and [Beaver](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/464.pdf) | Decentralized markets\n[JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), [JAM app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbyjG2upGO8) and [Wasabi](https://docs.wasabiwallet.io/) | CoinJoin implementation\n[Peer-to-Peer Exchanges](https://github.com/cointastical/P2P-Trading-Exchanges/) | Peer-to-peer exchanges\n[Keybase](https://keybase.io/) | Identity & Reputation management\n[Abra](https://www.goabra.com/) | Global P2P money transmitter network\n[Bitcore](http://bitcore.io/) | Open source Bitcoin javascript library\n[Bitcoin Knots](https://bitcoinknots.org/) | A Bitcoin Node (Within Consensus Fork of Bitcoin Core)\n\n## Bitcoin Units\n\nOne bitcoin is worth quite a lot (thousands of £/$/€), so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:\n\nUnit | Symbol | Value | Info\n---|:---:|---|---\nbitcoin | BTC | 1 bitcoin | one bitcoin is equal to 100 million satoshis\nmillibitcoin | mBTC | 1,000 per bitcoin | used as default unit in Electrum wallet\nbit | μBTC | 1,000,000 per bitcoin | colloquial \"slang\" term for microbitcoin\nsatoshi | sat | 100,000,000 per bitcoin | smallest unit in bitcoin, named after the inventor\n\nFor example, assuming an arbitrary exchange rate of $10,000 for one bitcoin, a $10 meal would equal:\n\n* 0.001 BTC\n* 1 mBTC\n* 1,000 bits\n* 100,000 sats\n\nFor more information check out the [bitcoin units wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinWiki/wiki/bitcoin_units).\n\n---\n\n**Still have questions?**  Feel free to ask in the comments below or stick around for our weekly [Mentor Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/search/?q=title%3A%22mentor+monday%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all) thread.

    "selftext": "My background is Islamic law students.  And I used to really admire one of my Islamic jurisprudence professors back in college. Brilliant guy… until the topic of Bitcoin came up.\n\nNot because solely i disagree with his view, but he's ego and  lack of understanding it without doing a research or deeper research about it.\n\nHe dismissed it confidently as “unethical speculation,” and that honestly shocked me. Yes, Bitcoin *can* be used for speculation — just like gold, property, or any asset. But reducing it **only** to speculation shows how deeply many scholars are trapped in a fiat-based mindset.\n\nIf they actually studied basic free-market economics, monetary history, or the fundamentals of Bitcoin, they’d realize Islam has always supported honest trade, transparency, and hard, tamper-proof assets. Bitcoin fits those principles far more than inflationary fiat ever will.\n\nIn Islamic jurisprudence, when dealing with new contemporary issues, there is a foundational principle:\n\n**الحكم على الشيء فرع عن تصوره**\n\n*“The ruling on something is built upon one’s understanding of it.”*\n\nIf the understanding is incorrect, the ruling will be incorrect.\n\nThat’s exactly what’s happening. Many fatwas (popular scholar answer) against Bitcoin focus strictly on **gharar** (uncertainty), while ignoring Bitcoin’s actual reality — its scarcity, decentralization, verifiability, and global consensus. They judge it only by volatility, not by its function as a permissionless, censorship-resistant form of money.\n\nTo me, this isn’t even a religious issue. It’s an **economic literacy** issue.\n\nAnd ironically, every scholar who *does* understand macroeconomics ends up supporting Bitcoin — because it protects people from inflation, corruption, and the silent theft of state-controlled debasement.\n\nBitcoin aligns with Islamic monetary ethics far more than the current fiat system ever could.\n\nAs the Qur’an says:\n\n**ولا تاكلوا اموالكم بينكم بالباطل**\n\n*“Do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly.”* (2:188)\n\nWhat’s more unjust than inflation stealing people’s savings?\n\n  \n\\*So many douchebags here trying to derail my specific topics about Bitcoin in Islamic perspective. I'm not here to hear your justification to whatever you believe. If you're so sure about your believe, you don't need to hate or confront Islam, It's yours, and again out of topic. Also many of wrong and false claims here from people accusing Islam this or that without proper understanding from good source, mixing politics, culture and religion. Again OUT OF TOPIC! ",

    "selftext": "\n\nWe’re in 2025. Bitcoin made a new ATH in October (~$126k), but by December we’re back near $90k, which puts BTC red YTD. That alone already deviates from how the post-halving year has historically behaved.\n\nIf the classic 4-year cycle were intact, 2025 should look like sustained expansion. Instead, we got a brief ATH and a sharp pullback. That also creates a problem for 2026. Historically, the year after the peak is the worst of the four. If 2026 ends up being an up year, that would directly contradict the model.\n\nSo what would actually break the cycle?\n• Losing long-term support for an extended period\n• No meaningful new highs within a reasonable post-halving window\n• Long-term holders selling into weakness\n• 2026 behaving like an expansion year instead of a reset\n\nWhat would keep it alive?\n• Holding long-term structure\n• Another ATH that holds, not just a brief spike\n• A clear post-peak cooldown in 2026\n\nNone of this proves the cycle is dead yet, but between timing, structure, and behavior, it does feel like the 4-year model is being tested in a real way.\n\nHonestly, even reading my own bullet points makes me scratch my head. That this is what it takes to either confirm or disproved the cycle. It seems to me that it has clearly been changed, but the dagger in the heart will be 2026 being an expansion green year. ",

Does a **Bitcoin-only** analytics platform make sense, or is multi-chain a must for you?\n2. Is the **ability to download chart data** something you’d personally use?\n3. Are PlanB / cycle-based charts still useful to you, or do you think they’re overrated now?\n4. Do you think that if we add AI to \"predict\" where Bitcoin \n5.

This isn’t noise — it’s the kind of compression that tends to precede real momentum.\n\nHistorically, Bitcoin’s biggest mid-cycle power moves show up before the final blow-off tops. Right now, Fisher Transform oscillations are tightening toward a breakout zone, suggesting energy is building under the surface.\n\nAdd in the halving-cycle rhythm, and the picture gets even more interesting. The sine-wave structure lines up with rising momentum pushing into 2025–2026, a window that has historically hosted some of Bitcoin’s most aggressive expansions.\n\nStructurally, this setup looks uncomfortably similar to the pre-top expansion phases we saw in 2013, 2017, and 2021 — not the tops themselves, but the moments right before volatility turned feral.\n\nIf history rhymes again, the next expansion phase won’t be subtle. Cycles are compressing, volatility is loading, and when Bitcoin finally chooses a direction, it tends to move fast.\n\n🧩 Stay sharp.

    "selftext": "Something I made in hopes of a clear headed view of it. I'm a college student currently and I do have BTC. I'm not someone who has that much money to spend, but I do have some, and this is not a way to antagonize. It's a clear headed way of looking at it, hopefully.\n\nBitcoin is a bet on demand and adoption, isn't it? It's what I think. Do it irresponsibly and you might even call it a gamble. Its true, as money it's bad (at its current state, I think you all know why). As a hedge against inflation? It's been here for 16 years with no concise way of knowing it'll stay or keep its performance. Intrinsically, its backed by speculators (my opinion).\n\nIt's a bet that enough people believe it'll go up, that is, more people will also believe it as a way to increase their money. If enough people believe it for long enough, it may get a little bit of a normative position in society's view of finance. But that's only \"if\". If enough believe in it, it might stay valuable. \"If\". Eventually with increased marketcap, it'll be harder to make money there and then it'd be like, well, an alternative to gold, really. Or, the cycle could become the norm and it'd be an asset where people gamble for periods of times.\n\nBitcoin is a gambled speculative allocation based on long term belief adoption. And your allocation probably should be how comfortable you are with that, 1-5% probably (Consider enough exposure if it succeeds, while not enough pain if it fails). It's a bet on adoption and demand, some people want that bet, some don't. Bitcoin is not guaranteed, not inevitable, not backed by fundamentals, not a proven hedge, not money today. Again, it's a bet on adoption and demand (some people want that bet, some don't.)\n\nThank you and do engage if you say there's an aspect missed so that others consider it.\n\nI made a recent post in the most bearish sub for bitcoin (you know which sub), and they should have pointers to consider on why bitcoin adoption and demand making it into a financial norm in some way or niche has difficulties.\n\nedit: typo",

Want to adjust volume on the fly? Simply scroll your mouse wheel. Have a side-scrolling wheel? You can seek through your video effortlessly.\n\nFor advanced playback, the app includes links and instructions for ClipGrab — making it easy to download YouTube videos, convert tricky audio tracks to MP3, turn subtitles into SRT/VTT, and attach them to your videos for a rare combination of features in one browser app.\n\nOther treats include A-B looping, perfect for revisiting moments again and again. Note: Firefox may have limited support for some features — for the full experience, a Chromium-based browser is recommended.",

That felt more like a low-timeframe bull trap than simple profit-taking. \n\nSo far buyers have defended 90k twice, so I don’t really see panic yet. Levels I’m watching, Upside: 91.5k (near-term resistance), 92.8–93k, then 94k and the big 100k magnet. Downside: 90–90.7k (key line), then 89k, and if things really roll over maybe 84–85k.",

I saw people truly believing it would change everything. And you know what happened? We became a meme. I might be wrong, I know I might, but just look at most Bitcoin communities. We have a tool that could decentralize power, build private cities, create free education... and what do we do? Scroll through Elon memes? I keep watching all this massive potential being wasted on unfunny jokes just so people can feel like they belong somewhere. It’s frustrating, because I believed, and still believe.\n\nMaybe I’m too old school, seeing things that aren’t there anymore. But I saw that shift happen. I saw blockchain arrive with the promise of revolution and turn into a gambling casino. I saw the power we could’ve had in our hands become social-media entertainment. This isn’t judgment, it’s honesty. We have real power to build true alternatives, yet we keep clicking on memes. Maybe I’m wrong about how things will unfold, but at least hear what I’m trying to say...",

    "selftext": "I've been putting off buying Bitcoin for like 3 months now because every time I try to research it I get overwhelmed. My friend tried explaining it to me but he started talking about private keys and hardware wallets and seed phrases and I just checked out. Is it actually that complicated or is he overcomplicating things? Like, can I just download an app, buy Bitcoin, and that's it? Or is there actually a bunch of technical stuff I need to understand first?  \nAlso I keep seeing people argue about which platform to use and I have no idea how to choose. Coinbase seems to be the most popular but people say it's expensive. Kraken is cheaper but looks complicated. There's also Gemini, YouHodler, Binance (which I heard has legal issues?), and a bunch of others I've never heard of. The fee thing is also confusing. I saw someone say they paid 3% to buy Bitcoin and another person said they paid 0.1%. That's a huge difference. How do I know what I'm actually going to pay? And then there's the question of where to keep it after buying. Some people say leave it on the exchange, others say that's dangerous and you need a hardware wallet. But hardware wallets cost money and seem complicated to set up.\n\nI'm not trying to be a crypto expert, I just want to buy like $500 worth of Bitcoin and see what happens. Does it really need to be this complicated or am I overthinking everything?\n\n",

    "title": "Bitcoin as Technological Nonsense: A Pointless, Self-Referential Hash-Guessing Game",
    "selftext": "Let us imagine an online game called SecureClicker. Every ten minutes the system randomly selects one winning field on a grid of unimaginable size. Players use real electricity and buy specialized machines to guess as many fields as fast as possible. The first player to hit the winning field gets points written into a public scoreboard.\n\n\n\nCrucially, every winning guess is sealed with an enormous amount of computational work. This makes it practically impossible to go back and rewrite past scoreboard entries without redoing all the work from that point forward, faster than the rest of the network combined. This costly proof is marketed as the game’s killer feature: the scoreboard is now “immutable” and “ultra-secure.” No one can steal or erase your points without spending insane amounts of energy.\n\nJohn hits the winning field and gets 1 point written into the scoreboard. Alice runs five times as much hardware and gets 5 points. The points are simply the result of who expended more energy.\n\nNow Steve comes along and pays 100 000 dollars to have John’s point transferred to him on the scoreboard while John’s score is reset to zero.\n\nQuestion: did Steve invest? Did John and Alice create tokens, money, or assets? No, it is absurd to even ask.\n\nThis is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of guessing fields, players (incorrectly called miners) try to guess the hash number that the network has set as the target. The first to guess it gets point (BTC) written into the public scoreboard (the blockchain). Every new block is sealed with the same enormous computational proof that makes rewriting history astronomically expensive. This proof is marketed as Bitcoin’s main value proposition: your points are “seizure-resistant digital property.”\n\nBut here is the crucial point: this has nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy. Let us explain why.\n\nInvesting presupposes the existence of a resource that generates a return.\n\nWith stocks, there is a company with economic activity. The number 100 is not points but a measure of the size of your share in that company. The return in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation proceeds comes from that resource. A higher number means you are entitled to a higher return.\n\nThe dollar is a more complex type of investment where the resource is debt. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces, for example, a car. You buy the car and pay in dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives those dollars, it simply deletes them from its balance sheet and they disappear. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank.\n\nAnother example: you pay taxes to the state in dollars. The state uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service (your tax obligation was erased and you are not going to jail). That return again came from the debtor, this time the state.\n\nSo the numbers in the above cases quantify the share in resources (company and debt) that generate returns. Bitcoin is not issued as a share in a company or as someone’s debt, so there is no resource generating a return for Bitcoin holders. Bitcoin is literally issued only as a point in a guessing game, and the only thing being secured by all the expensive proof is the point table itself.\n\nThese points are also not tokens, money, or assets, because all such things involve some obligation, physical substance, or digital content.\n\nA token represents an obligation of the issuer: 100 on a casino chip or gift card means the issuer owes money or goods, and a larger number means a larger obligation. With physical substances such as grain, metal, or oil, and with digital ones such as MP3s, videos, e-books, or apps, a larger number means you hold more mass, more volume, or more digital content.\n\nIf John has 100 BTC and Alice has 1 BTC, that does not mean the issuer owes John a hundred times more money or goods. It does not mean John holds a hundred times more physical material or digital files. It only means he has a larger number on the scoreboard. Just as there is no resource to invest in, there’s no substance to be a token, money, or an asset.\n\nThe expensive proof does not change anything fundamental: the only thing being secured is the scoreboard itself, and the only reason miners keep producing that proof is that the points on the scoreboard still command a price. When that price collapses far enough, miners turn off their machines, the security collapses with it, and the ultra-secure points instantly become trivially rewriteable points again.\n\nIt is funny (and a little sad) how many people do not realize that Bitcoin is just a giant, energy-intensive, self-referential guessing game in which participants bet that someone will keep paying to maintain the illusion that meaningless points are valuable because they are “secure,” and they are “secure” only as long as people keep paying for them.\n\nThe whole thing remains technological nonsense and has literally nothing to do with money, investing, finance, or the economy.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin is doomed to reach 999 googoplexillions and the Graham's number over the long-run, because this is how the hard money math works.\n\nSame principle applies to silver and gold which are real, not fiat, money, historically speaking. Bitcoin is the digital version of gold and silver, plus additional benefits like not being physical and heavy, being anonymous, etc...\n\nSo, mathematically speaking, the following is true:\n\nAs fiat value goes down, hard money's value (in this case, BTC) goes up. If fiat value declines indefinitely, BTC value should grow indefinitely.\n\nI heard that once a fiat currency reaches a very large number and starts causing calculation issues in people's everyday life due to too many numbers and zeroes, it gets either revalued or replaced.\n\nFor example, if the dollar devalues by additional, say, 10,000%, it may get revalued or replaced with another currency that has lower numbers, which is basically deflation.\n\nFor example, under the current system, if we wait long enough, a candy will cost 100 billion, and a second hand car will cost 500 quadrillion.\n\nTo prevent such astonishing numbers that are difficult to work with, the government does a monetary reset, increasing the value of the currency, so a candy can cost 0.5 pennies and the second hand car will cost 200 dollars instead of 500 quadrillion.\n\nWhen Bitcoin reaches a high value like 500 billion or 1 trillion per coin, will a monetary reset crash the value?\n\nI'm investing in Bitcoin for the long-run, and I view it as hard money. Basically, I hope one day, we will switch back to hard money, and that's why I'm converting fiat to BTC and some precious metals like silver and gold. If we switch back, I will have real money. If we don't, eventually, I may sell for fiat.\n\nFiat is basically a debt-based system under which inflation is mandated and demanded. Question is, can this go on indefinitely or must there be a monetary reset eventually, and if there is one, what happens to our BTC stack?",

This time around, I'd prefer a device that's much easier to use as my wife isn't in the space and I'd prefer to get something she can easily use in case of an emergency that doesn't have a steep learning curve like some of the competitors without sacrificing overall security.\n\nIf there's one you feel might fit the bill that's outside the Ledger ecosystem, please feel free to share.

But I noticed that I can borrow against my btc at 6.39% variable rate up to 86%LTV. Obviously I ain’t gonna borrow even 50% of my btc cuz I can’t imagine getting liquidated for this but I thought this was a pretty good trade. I’m aware btc can nose dive next year and maybe drop another 50% which is why I’m borrowing very little…\n\nHowever to make this even sweeter, I just noticed that I can earn 6.44% apy on my USDC. So a part of me wonders, while these rates are subject to change, it sounds like a great deal that I’m pretty much borrowing against my bitcoin for free. Has anyone done this? Thoughts? I’m considering taking out a small loan and trying this out. I also noticed that lending has an outage as far as dec 9. Not sure if this an ongoing issue. I feel like considering it’s COIN the tech is very secure and while Morpho isn’t exactly COIN, I feel like COIN has done its DD with this.\n\nAnyway thoughts and suggestions on this idea to borrow, what seems like free money, against a hard asset (in this case the hardest form of money).\n\nThanks!",

    "selftext": "**AMA: We are Bluechip – an independent, stablecoin rating agency.**\n\nHello r/ethereum, I’m Amey - Ratings Director at Bluechip.\n\nStablecoins offer a cheaper way to make cross-border transactions and a more reliable way to save in economies with high inflation or unstable financial systems. But how can you tell which stablecoins are truly stable?\n\nOur SMIDGE rating framework analyzes six economic factors and assigns letter-grade ratings (from F to A+) to identify the most reliable stablecoins. You can read the full framework on our website [here](https://cms.bluechip.org/assets/ef4d829e-3874-484a-91dd-3e6d98dbe464).\n\nEssentially, the SMIDGE framework evaluates - \n\n* Stability - collateral quality, asset segregation, core stability mechanism\n* Management - track record of team, jurisdiction, accountability to token holders\n* Implementation - technical risk (currently not tracked)\n* Decentralization - censorship risk, blacklisting (only for crypto-backed stablecoins)\n* Governance - regulatory protections, redemption terms, voting systems\n* External - market sentiment (currently not tracked)\n\nWe take a crypto-native, independent, and data-driven approach to stablecoin ratings. Our framework is the first publicly available, factor-based risk model for evaluating stablecoins. Our ratings are publicly available on our website [here](https://bluechip.org). Currently, USDT is rated D and USDC is rated B+ by Bluechip.\n\nLast month, we partnered with the Ethereum Foundation to host Bluechip25 in Vienna, the first global conference dedicated to crypto safety. Sign up for updates on next year's Bluechip26 on our website [here](https://conference.bluechip.org).\n\nWe also host a podcast called Bluechip Dialogues, where our Chief Economist Garett Jones interviews leading figures in crypto. Watch the latest episode with the creator of Facebook’s stablecoin project Diem (formerly Libra) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4TQF-nMWZY).\n\nFollow us on Twitter [here](https://x.com/bluechip_org) or LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bluechip-org) or Telegram channel [here](https://t.me/bluechip_org).\n\nAsk us anything! I'll be around to answer your questions over the following days.",

    "selftext": "Hi, total crypto newbie here. \n\nI need some guidance and expert advice on the best way to approach my financial needs. \n\n**Context**: I live in a developing country, and I am in desperate need of financial freedom. I started looking into stablecoins, especially USDT. I am not really looking into trading. \n\n**My use case:** Relative or friend in europe, they buy USDT on Binance or any other exchange platform, send that USDT to my Trust wallet. I store it, and occasionally send some pocket money to Redotpay to spend using their virtual visa card. That is pretty much about it.   \nStoring it and spending with Redotpay. \n\nNot super interested in p2p market. So i dont think i will need to sell my USDT that often, almost never. So the market standard for p2p transactions isnt really a big concern. \n\nMight be interested in trading one day, but not for now. \n\nThis is just for my personal finances and spending. \n\n**The question I need help with**: Should I use Ethereum or Tron. \n\n\n\nMy findings with the research I did:  \n\n* Tron has cheaper gas fee, for when I transfer to Redotpay. But apparently Eth have dropped their transfer rates for USDT, and a lot of people claim it is around the same price now. Because the numbers I found are a little worrying: around 1 USD for Tron and between 3-8 USD for Eth. If you have any information about the rates that would be great.\n* I am more inclined towards Eth to be fair. I just like the idea of a trully decentralized chain. And it has been king over a decade for good reasons. Also it is more secure.\n* With the new EIP-7702 on Eth, you can now pay gas fee for transfers with USDT, which is very interesting, as I am not very comfortable with juggling two currencies. Since per my understanding, I need to always have TRX reserve in my Trust wallet to be able to send to Redotpay.\n* Are the fees really that different to justify skipping on EIP-7702 ?  \n* Some people mentioned using an L2 on Eth. I honestly have no idea what that is. \n\n  \nIf i have got any concepts misunderstood, I would appreciate any clarifications and guidance. I still got a lot to learn about this field. ",

    "title": "Devconnect 2025: Payment Apps",
    "selftext": "(This is an EVMavericks production.)\n\nDuring Devconnect 2025 in Buenos Aires, payment apps that bridge stablecoins to Argentina's peso economy were launching, updating, and competing for users. I tested as many of them as I could. Here's what worked, what didn't, and what you should know if you're planning a trip to Argentina with stablecoins in your wallet.\n\n---\n\n**Stablecoin Cards**\n\nI had two debit cards before I started: Metamask and GnosisPay. These worked in most places that accept cards, but were denied a few times.  Generally, if one card was denied, the other was as well, so clearly there is something slightly different about them from the card reader point of view. The most noticeable instance of this was Subte turnstiles, which accept bank-issued cards for subway travel, but rejected both of the stablecoin cards consistently. I didn't dare try the cards on the bus, for fear of the driver kicking me off.\n\n**QR code Payments**\n\nMany merchants, ranging from kiosks to grocery stores to restaurants accept payment via QR code, usually through Mercado Pago or MODO. The QR payment system is regulated by the Central Bank of Argentina under the *Transferencias 3.0* initiative, which requires that all payment service providers and banks use the same standardized QR code generator. There are a number of Web3 apps which plug into this QR scaffolding, making it easy to pay using stablecoins via the apps, as long as you have Internet access.\n\nUsually, the merchant generates a QR code for you at the point of sale. You scan this code in the app and then confirm the transaction. Some smaller shops have a static QR code displayed near the cash register. You scan that for the merchant information and then enter the amount yourself, which then sends a confirmation of the amount paid to the checkout.\n\nEither way, once you confirm, the funds are debited from your account and the merchant receives pesos with a confirmation on their terminal that you paid. It's all very easy and straightforward.\n\nMerchants often reacted with surprise that I, clearly a tourist, was able to pay by QR code, so being able to interact with this system as an outsider is clearly still new. Some merchants only accepted direct transfers and did not have the terminal in order to generate a QR code. None of these apps were able to do a direct transfer in this way.\n\n**P2P(dot)me**\n\nThe only payment system that I found which felt aligned to Decentralized Finance (permissionless and trustless within a reputation framework) was P2P(dot)me,  a decentralized bridge between stablecoins and local bank/payment rails.\n\nThey match USDC-fiat swaps using smart contracts on Base and a network of \"human liquidity providers\".\n\nAt a coffee shop, I entered the cost of my order into the app, where I was matched with an offer taker who wanted to buy my USDC. Then I asked the server for a QR code to pay. I scanned that QR code, which was passed to the taker, who bought my USDC and paid my bill in pesos. It was a little bit slow but well within the tolerances of my coffee shop waitress.\n\nI tried it again in a shop where I didn't know how much the bill would be in advance. Even so, it was just fast enough for me to wait for my offer to be accepted and then scan the QR code before the terminal timed out, needing just a little patience from the shopkeeper.\n\nYou are limited to one transaction a day up to a value of $10 USD unless you go through their zero-knowledge KYC to verify yourself as a user. The limit is raised to 10 transactions and a $100 limit if you verify using a social media account (X, Instagram, Facebook, GitHub). If you verify with LinkedIn or ZKpassport, the limit is raised to $200 per day.\n\nI can vouch for the fact that P2P(dot)me worked great in Buenos Aires. It is apparently also popular in India, Brazil and Indonesia.\n\n**Peanut Cash**\n\nThe belle of the ball was Peanut Cash, with their hot pink messaging and aggressive social media campaign. Peanut allows you to send/request money from other users and to pay for services using QR codes.\n\nIn order to use QR code payments, you have to KYC with an identity document and your residential information. The actual KYC is done by a third-party and varies somewhat by nationality. The payments are handled by Peanut and their banking/payment partners.\n\nPeanut offers perks, up to 20% cashback on specific transactions, based on a tier-based system of referrals and usage.\n\nThe Chromium app uses passkeys saved with Apple or Google. You can transfer money out of the wallet that they created on your behalf but there is no way to gain control of it: you cannot access or export the private keys. They claim to be self-custodial, as they don't actually hold the funds and can't seize or spend them. I would call the wallet *not custodial*.\n\nDuring the conference, Peanut announced that you could now use RedATM cash points to withdraw cash from the app via QR, up to 500,000 pesos, which is much more than bank ATMs using foreign cards. This is a big deal: when I tried to use a debit card at a bank ATM,  I was limited to 30,000 pesos, about twenty dollars, with a seven dollar transaction fee. Peanut Cash with RedATM allows withdrawals of up to 500,000 pesos with a fee of under $5, which was very useful for getting cash quickly.\n\n**Yodl**\n\nYodl Pay allows you to deposit USDT and pay using QR payment systems in Argentina, Brazil, the Philippines and Vietnam. They also offer Yodl Go for P2P payments among other app users. It is non-KYC with the exception of Argentina.\n\nKYC for using the QR payment system within Argentina was through a third-party and asked for government-issued ID and address information.\n\nThe Yodl mobile app is available through Apple Store/Google Play for iOS and Android users.  On first use, the app generates an embedded wallet using Privy, allowing you to bypass Yodl completely and use Privy options to export your keys. I have no idea how to do this and I had to wade through their terms and conditions to even find that information. Instead, I simply withdrew the funds back to my own wallet.\n\nI had no issues paying with Yodl at any merchants who accepted QR payments; my only complaint would be that the app was sometimes slow to load.\n\n**Settle**\n\nSettle is a Farcaster-native wallet that offers crypto-to-crypto payments between users. Settle does not require KYC although obviously you must have a Farcaster account.\n\nThey spent the week of the conference onboarding local cafés and restaurants and ended up with about two dozen locations in Buenos Aires by the time I left. The big difference between Settle and the other apps is that there is no conversion: the buyer and the seller are trading in stablecoins, rather than a conversion to pesos at the point of sale.\n\nRather than cashback, specific locations offered discounts for paying with Settle, similar to existing discounts offered for paying in cash.\n\nI saw a few conference goers speak positively about crypto-adoption in Buenos Aires having seen the Settle signs. So far, they only have about two dozen merchants who accept direct crypto payments via Settle, but I hope the high profile of their merchant onboarding campaign might increase local acceptance of crypto payments.\n\nI didn't test it. Loading Farcaster and then the mini-app within Farcaster made me impatient, but mostly because I never ended up walking into any Settle-enabled locations.\n\n**Takenos**\n\nThe Takenos app was aggressively marketed during the final days of the conference with friendly young locals handing out flyers in English and Spanish offering $5 free for immediate sign-up with a referral code. Takenos is a custodial \"global wallet\" that allows you to hold USDC/USDT as well as various fiat (USD/EUR/BRL/ARS). It is aimed at LatAM freelancers and small businesses and available in Spanish only.\n\nTakenos runs on bank/FinTech rails and offers users payment card options along with QR payments within Argentina, with conversion to Argentine pesos happening at the point of sale. There are two cards available, a \"Spicy Card\" for payments in Argentina and a US-issued \"Take Card\" for use abroad and online in foreign currencies.\n\nKYC is required. I went through the KYC requirements to be told three days later that my application was unsuccessful. I have a particular dislike for protocols that use KYC as an invisible application process for their supposedly permissionless service. If there are requirements, they should be made known before KYC.\n\nI emailed their support for comment. I did not receive a reply.\n\n---\n\nBuenos Aires felt closer to crypto-native payments than anywhere else I've been. The solutions weren't perfect but they worked. Scan a code, send some stablecoins, walk away with an empanada.\n\nI'm currently visiting in the US, where the guy at the Walmart checkout laughed when I pulled out my phone to pay. No, they can't do contactless yet—do I have a physical card?\n\nI wouldn't wish the financial insecurity of Argentina on anyone, but I find myself missing these apps, especially the excitement of watching them grow and add features almost every day.

    "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been down a pretty deep rabbit hole looking for a **hot wallet (non-hardware)** that actually supports **custom HD derivation at the account level** *and* **BIP39 passphrases (25th word)**.\n\nSurprisingly, this combo seems to be mostly available only on hardware wallets or very niche software. Most mainstream hot wallets either lock derivation paths or ignore passphrases completely.\n\nSo far, the **only hot wallet I personally found** that seems to support both is **TokenPocket**. According to their docs, keys stay on-device and they allow more flexibility than most wallets.\n\nBefore fully committing, I’m curious:\n\n* Has anyone here actually used TokenPocket with **custom derivation paths + passphrase**?\n* Any thoughts on its security model or reputation?\n* Are there any other hot wallets I might be missing (mobile / desktop / CLI) that support this kind of setup for Ethereum / EVM?\n\nI know this is more of a power-user thing, but I’m guessing some of you have gone through the same search.\n\nAppreciate any insight 🙏",

    "selftext": "JUST IN: BitMine Immersion Technologies — led by Tom Lee — has purchased **138,452 ETH**, equivalent to about **US$435 million**, in its latest accumulation round. This bold move boosts BitMine’s total crypto holdings significantly, reinforcing its position as one of the largest institutional holders of Ethereum (ETH) worldwide. \n\nTom Lee and his team cited several catalysts behind this surge: the recent Fusaka upgrade to the Ethereum network — implemented 3 December — which promises improved scalability, security and usability. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions appear favorable, with expectations of a loosening monetary policy by the Federal Reserve potentially supporting broader crypto market recovery. \n\nThe scale of the purchase (over 138,000 ETH in just a week) marks a dramatic acceleration compared to previous buying patterns — reportedly about 156 % more than the firm’s weekly average four weeks ago.  In doing so, BitMine pushes further toward its longer-term target of controlling up to 5 % of Ethereum’s total supply. \n\nIn sum, this $435 million acquisition underlines BitMine’s growing conviction in Ethereum’s long-term potential, signaling confidence in both network upgrades and macroeconomic conditions that may favor a renewed bull cycle in crypto.",

It's a week before the conference and people are exchanging tips. \"You can trade USDT for pesos at any exchange,\" people tell me knowingly.\n\n\"Where, exactly?\"\n\nNot a single one of them is able to give me a location. There are exchange houses, they say with a bit of hand waving.  Just look for USDT stickers on the window along with the dollar and euro currency symbols. When I point out that I've been here for three weeks and not seen a single one, I'm told it's because I was staying in the wrong part of Buenos Aires. \"Go to Palermo, they are everywhere.\"\n\nI go to Palermo. They are definitely not everywhere. I ask at an exchange, in case there just isn't a sign. No: *no cripto*.   I ask other conference goers if they've seen any exchanges that take USDT. No one has. A few days later, one person in the conference Telegram group sends a photograph of an exchange that takes USDT. Success! The sign is explicit though: TRON only. I don't bother visiting.\n\nAt the cypherpunk conference, I speak to a Buenos Aires resident who refuses to do KYC on principle. I can't think of another city where you could exist without KYC. But when I point out how complicated I've found it to trade stablecoins for cash, he is surprised. Initially he says that the exchanges are everywhere but accepts my lived experience, that I never found a single one. He laughs when I tell him how frightened I was to meet with Blue. It's perfectly safe, he tells me. And yes, delivering the money through a man on a motorbike is common, although he concedes that maybe not on the first trade. But for visitors to the country, foreigners, doesn't he think that it's a bigger risk? I feel like even asking the question is making myself a target.\n\n\"That's what community is for,\" he tells me. \"You ask your friends, you get told where to go.\"\n\nFriends? Not only do I have to dodge scammers, guard seed phrases and pretend I understand half the apps I'm using. Now I have to have *friends*?\n\nOK... I do have friends, technically. But the Venn diagram of \"people who like me\", \"people who use crypto\" and \"people who understand Argentina's financial underworld\" is just three circles in the shape of a snowman.\n\nHe takes a bit of a breath, as if summoning patience, and tells me that the point is to trust the community. Ask on Twitter!\n\nTwitter? That same Twitter that told me I don't need cash in Buenos Aires? That's who he thinks I should ask? He agrees that maybe Twitter isn't the best example of a web of trust.  But really, trading with someone like Blue is very safe, he tells me, and borderline accuses me of having trust issues.\n\nHe might have a point.\n\nA herd of new payment apps explodes onto the scene in the week leading up to the conference.  I keep putting $20 into each app's wallet and hoping I remember to pull it all back out at the end. I pay using stablecoin cards and QR payment systems all over the city.\n\nMost of these allow me to pay in stablecoins while the vendor receives pesos. One very clever app pushes daily updates as they on-board restaurants all over the city, allowing the merchant to receive my stablecoins directly, without conversion. By the time I leave Buenos Aires, they've signed up over two dozen cafés and restaurants. The first QR-payment app that I installed has a big breakthrough during the conference: integration with a set of ATMs allowing the user to withdraw cash.  Another QR-based app ticks all my boxes: they connect me directly to buyers; I tell them how many USDT I need to pay my bill and once someone agrees to the purchase, I scan the QR code and they pay the merchant on my behalf. There's no KYC and no permission needed, just an online marketplace which works amazingly well. Meanwhile, all conference attendees are given a newbie-friendly wallet built into the Devconnect app, which allows them to pay for everything at the conference using stablecoins or crypto, no need for pesos at all.\n\nThese innovative approaches can only flourish in certain environments. Someone commented that Buenos Aires was perfectly positioned to be Ground Zero for crypto adoption. I agree. Maybe stablecoins aren’t a revolution here, but they are already accepted as another tool in the box.\n\nThe big difference was that my community had arrived. Devconnect 2025 had brought thousands of people to a conference hall in Buenos Aires to talk about exactly these problems and to offer solutions.\n\nObviously, physical exchanges that take USDT *do* exist. Once you find one, never again will you have to peer into shop windows looking like an orphan on Christmas Eve.  There's an active P2P community centered around Binance. Motorbike couriers with envelopes of money are apparently an accepted part of local finance, even if I declined to partake. People don't flinch when you mention crypto.\n\nThat's more than I can say for my hometown.\n\nWhatever comes next won’t be clean or ideological. It’ll look like Buenos Aires: improvised, relentless, and somehow functioning against the odds.\n\nIn the end, I proved that it is *possible* to deal with day-to-day life  using stablecoins, if not in a wholly decentralized and permissionless manner. With more local knowledge, I could *mostly* live on stablecoins without KYC, by converting to cash and being choosy about which shops and restaurants I frequented.\n\nNo, the people of Buenos Aires do not use stablecoins for transactions on a daily basis. There is clearly very little mainstream adoption of crypto payments. Right now, the main advantage of stablecoin apps and payment systems in Buenos Aires is that last-minute conversion to traditional rails and pesos.\n\nBut even that is a jump forward. The infrastructure exists. The current regulatory space allows for experimentation. People are already aware of the benefits of holding savings in stablecoin. The QR payment system is standardized, waiting to be plugged into. Developers are building, not debating whether to start.\n\nCall it early adoption, call it survival instinct. Whatever it is, Buenos Aires is ready long before anyone else is. Right now, they are not using Ethereum for their financial freedom. But they could.\n\nBuenos Aires isn’t running on stablecoins yet. But if any city decides to, it’ll be this one.\n\n---\n\nThis was an EVMavericks production.",

    "title": "3 Crucial Ethereum Updates in the Future Revealed by Vitalik Buterin",
    "selftext": "\nI copied and pasted for ease of access. Maybe Vitalik can make an update to raise this coin to $5000. \n\nEthereum's next evolution will be shaped by a set of upcoming invariants and protocol caps that Vitalik Buterin outlined. These are deep structural changes that harden the network, streamline clients and block entire classes of DoS vectors.\n\nEthereum's clear path\n\nZooming out over the past few years reveals a distinct pattern: Ethereum continues to move toward stringent, predictable limitations on the capabilities of a single transaction or block. And that trend is going to pick up speed.\n\nThe groundwork was already in place. In 2021, EIP-2929 and 3529 increased SLOAD gas costs and slashed refunds, reducing disk I/O abuse and preventing refund-based spam loops. One of the most exploitable instructions in the EVM was eliminated in 2024 by Dencuns SELFDESTRUCT nerf, which closed significant complexity gaps. Now, in 2025, the 16777216 gas-per-transaction hard cap finishes the cycle: no more super-dense monster transactions capable of locking up nodes or stressing clients in unpredictable ways.\n\nEach of these constraints trims the attack surface while pushing Ethereum closer to a system where worst-case behavior is strictly bounded.\n\nThree paths\n\nThe first path is a cap on the number of contract code bytes accessed per transaction. In the short term, this means it becomes more costly to call large contracts. In the medium term, it standardizes contract scaling and eliminates pathological situations where a single call thrashes through megabytes of bytecode, pushing the ecosystem toward binary trees and per-chunk pricing.\n\nSecond, ZK-EVM prover cycle bounds are required by Ethereum. Repricing proofs are becoming more and more important as ZK-based layer 2s become more common. Without restrictions, block builders could create consensus-layer bottlenecks by packing proofs with excessive computational overhead. Bound it, and the network benefits from safer L2 growth and predictable verification costs.\n\nThird, there will be changes to memory prices. Although EVM memory expansion is currently quasi-bounded, attackers can still push clients into uncomfortable areas. Every client team can easily handle worst-case modeling, and execution engines are made simpler with a more transparent hard cap on memory usage.",

    "title": "Thought experiment, how much extra time would it cost to internally shard block production in a geographically distributed way (on a simpler ledger like the older UTXO-model)?",
    "selftext": "I was recently censored by Edmund something, so I thought I would ask this community if you could disprove an assumption I have considered. I have considered a scaling paradigm, and here would like to ask about it for a simpler ledger like UTXO-model (and the idea is that the same principles can be scaled up to more advanced \"world computer\" like Ethereum). It seems appropriate to attack my argument rather than censor me for having respect for another individual (Craig Wright).\n\nMy idea is very simple. Shard a UTXO ledger by transaction hash mod numShards. There is \"wiggle room\" for nodes to shard with different values, as it can translate back and forth. Then, if 1024 shards, let shard 0 build blocks only with transaction hashes it \"owns\", and any shard using those as inputs will have to request the right from the shard. The shards manage and stores such \"virtual blocks\". Propagation of mempool transactions as well as \"virtual blocks\" is between shards only (or, mainly). Shards will request transactions from mempool by modulo numShards, and similar with the \"virtual block\" (where the boundaries of that block is the Merkle tree, so it naturally also splits and combines so people can use different numShards). The central block header is signed by the \"coordinator\" (via proof-of-work or proof-of-stake or proof-of-suffrage) who combines the Merkle roots of the sub-blocks. They trust all their \"sub-nodes\" internally. Likewise, the transaction fees can be done easily in UTXO-format by each sub-node reporting their own output for coinbase.\n\nAssuming 1 MB blocks and 1024 shards, 5000 transactions per block, on average 2-3 inputs per transaction, on average 10-15 requests per shard-pair.\n\nThe geographical distribution solves the bandwidth bottleneck (as well as computation and storage to some extent) and lets less advanced hardware still team-up to easily operate on gigabyte (or more) blocks.\n\nWhat is the added latency would people here say from the geographical distribution of the shards?\n\n***Update:*** *I realized that for arbitrary degree of sharding, the leaves of the Merkle tree has to be ordered in a predictable way, by transaction hashes. Such predictable \"proof-of-structure\" allows parallel shards operating under a node/validator/miner a leader. It turned out Bitcoin Cash upgraded for exactly that (\"Canonical Transaction Ordering\") in 2018, for exactly the reasons I saw with the architecture (even if they may not have emphasized the geographical and social distribution aspect as much). They published about that at the time. I need someone to solve scaling for the \"simultaneous video event\" I invented between 2015 and 2018 and Gavin Wood is now approaching. Note, a predictable proof-of-structure that allows parallel shards under shared central leader could be other things than Merkle tree. A merkle tree is constrained to blocks. A Patricia Merkle Trie is not technically, and the \"block of authority\" that signs the \"proof-of-structure\" could be a separate thing to the transaction trie, likely. /Johan*",

I'm dangerously close to falling in love with the city but that might just be a side effect of the long-term exposure to exhaust and capybara memes.\n\nI find a cheap flight to Jujuy. My brain floods with visions of  hiking in the Andes with my pockets full of pesos. I'll drink some wine, I'll pet a llama, maybe I'll even do some writing.\n\nBut traditional finance fails me. The airline refuses my cards. All of them. Cryptocards, debit cards, credit card from a reputable European bank.  Declined and  denied with a vague error and a customer service bot which repeatedly tells me that foreign cards are not a problem and I should check that I entered my card details correctly.\n\nI have half a dozen new apps on my phone to pay with stablecoins. I've gone through the KYC and been accepted for most of them, so that I can test them one-by-one. Mostly they work well. I don't even need to put money in them in advance; once I know what I want to buy, I can quickly move stablecoins into the app and they appear immediately.  But the apps are no use to me for paying for online purchases; I need a person with a terminal generating a QR code to use them.\n\nThere's third-party aggregator that looks like it scraped the flight off of Google but actually allows me to pay for the flight. Just one catch: no luggage. Not even a carry on. They suggest that I buy extras separately, from the airline that cannot manage a card transaction.\n\nFine. I don't need  luggage.\n\nI strip my belongings down to the essentials. There's a storage company that operates on some sort of decentralized custody protocol for personal belongings. You book online, get the address of a location somewhere in your chosen neighbourhood, and give them all of your earthly possessions.\n\nMy assigned drop point is a phone shop in San Telmo, crammed with AI-art cases and knockoff chargers. I give them my number and hand them my suitcase. All I can do is trust that the shop is still here when I return.\n\nI take the bus to the airport wearing three layers of clothing, a spare set of underwear shoved into my handbag. I have both phones, Kindle, tablet and keyboard and a tangle of cables tucked into my hoodie pockets, looking like one of those street vendors who open up their coat and show you a wide range of goods.\n\nAt the airport, I unpack everything to pass through security. I need three trays. After I pack myself back up, a man with a wand points out that I have a cable trailing behind me.\n\nAt the gate, the Argentines start forming a queue an hour before boarding, pure social  contract magic. I stay seated like a savage until I see our plane pull up to the gate and dump its last cargo of tourists and gauchos.\n\nI squish into the middle seat and try to keep my hoodie spilling over the sides, redistributing items until I finally get the seatbelt over my middle. I do not exhale for the entire two hour flight.\n\nThe airport is not in San Salvador and the bus to Tilcara, my chosen destination, is. I purchase a shuttle ticket and wait outside to stand in the rain until it is full and we are ready to go.\n\nThe bus station is impossibly clean and bright. A woman at an information booth appears improbably happy to see me, checks the time and tells me  which bus company has a bus leaving next which will stop at Ticara. The woman at the bus company is less happy to see me but, after realizing that I blatantly don't have a clue what I am doing, writes helpful notes in the margins of my ticket: bus will arrive in 40 minutes, somewhere between bay 08 and 13, it will say Humahuaca on the front and Evelia on the side.\n\nI ask if they take QR payments. She points out that there is a 10% discount for cash for the ticket. I pay cash.\n\nForty minutes later, I wedge myself into my bus seat, attempting to take off my hoodie in a way that does not tip all of my electronics  on the floor. And then we drive. The windows fog up and all I can see outside is black rain. I am desperate not to fall asleep and end up in some abandoned village where they've never heard of Ethereum or vowels.\n\nIt's past eleven when the bus pulls into Tilcara. A cracked parking lot. A couple of guys loitering with intent. I check my phone: a 25-minute walk  to the hostel, which I had glibly told the hostel would be easy as I have no bags.\n\nThe air is thin and every road heads uphill. I can't find any street signs. The paved road quickly deteriorates into a dirt track. Shop shutters rattle closed as I walk past. When I manage to make eye contact with anyone, I get a dead stare. Every time I check my phone map, it tells me that I've gone the wrong way. Again.\n\nI should have stayed in Buenos Aires, I think. I loved every millimeter of Buenos Aires. People mostly smiled at me, said  hello. There were coffee shops and restaurants and street lights. Here, there's just dirt and altitude.\n\nDefiantly, I  mutter *buenas noches* under my breath at the next person coming towards me. She nods, replies. Shit. Am I supposed to be greeting people?\n\nTwo turns from my hostel, the road dips downhill. Somewhere along the way, I climbed up a hill I didn't need to. I curse the Andean gods and keep walking.\n\nFinally, I arrive, punch in the code, and crash into my bed. It's midnight. I sleep like the dead.\n\nAnd then, morning. It's like someone rewired Tilcara overnight. It's beautiful. Still dusty and crumbling but golden in the morning light with misty black and red mountains creating a backdrop that looks like a motivational poster. I discover that street signs do exist, just not where you'd expect, hand painted onto walls and fences at random heights as you walk down the road.\n\nI scan the restaurant chalkboards, making mental lists of all the dishes I want to try, then pause, not quite emotionally ready to consider *Llama al Malbec* for my special evening meal.\n\nMaybe tomorrow.\n\nThe locals have stern faces carved from stone until I whisper *buen día*, at which point they smile and greet me. I try it louder. Everyone seems happy to see me. Some even ask *que tál?*, how are you?, and actually seem to expect an answer.\n\nI respond with a slump and  a wheeze,  universal code for *every road in this town is uphill and I am dying*. I am met with laughter, sympathy and one invitation to a cold beer (I should have said yes).\n\nThe hotel also gives a 10% discount for paying in cash, so I use up the rest of the pesos from Blue. I ask the woman if she knows where I can buy pesos in Tilcara.\n\nThere are two Western Unions in town and a gift shop called Native Art who will exchange dollars for pesos. But what about stablecoins?\n\nShe stares at me blankly.\n\nNever mind, I tell her. It doesn't matter anymore.\n\nAnd it really doesn't.\n\n---\n\nJump straight to the conclusion! **[Apparently I Did It Wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pgnd03/part_eight_apparently_i_did_it_wrong/)**  (\"You should have just used X, bro.\")",

    "selftext": "I'm the inventor of the \"simultaneous video event\" Gavin Wood is currently pursuing (Gavin built the first version of Ethereum, then Jeffrey Wilckes and his team built the Golang, and then more came). I have followed \"scaling\" discussion since 2014, but always found that it was misunderstanding the Nakamoto consensus. But since my proof-of-unique-person requires someone to solve scaling, I took some more looks at the topic and I realized that what the discussion was missing is that the consensus should not be split. Everything happening under a \"block of authority\" should be by the same group, who trusts one another internally. With that, parallelization can still happen, but the consensus is not split. The concept is really similar otherwise to the \"sharding\" discussion, it only avoids splitting the consensus.\n\nWhat the discussion in Ethereum was typically in the past decade was to instead randomly assign validators to \"shards\" from the validator pool. This approach fundamentally misunderstands the consensus.\n\nAs I realized what everyone got wrong, I was unable to find a system that actually did scale the way things should be done. But, I then noticed there is a system. But if I even mention that here, this gets removed. Not because of the topic I raise, but because of guilt by association. You have created a \"community\" where you have erased the roots to it, as well as made mention of actual competition (as the roots are often a form of competition, Steve Wozniak would remain a form of competition even as the computer industry outgrew his Apple 2 etc). The system I mentioned is teranode, that is parallelizing the block production but they do so internally under a singular trusted central authority for the \"block\". Of course Ethereum was the next step after Bitcoin, and my proof-of-unique-person is fundamentally based on the Ethereum paradigm. But Satoshi was who came up with the consensus. Buterin came up with the Turing completeness. Buterin, and Gavin Wood, and Jeffrey Wilckes, were all geniuses in my eyes. But so was Satoshi.\n\n>*\"Removing this because it's not about Ethereum.*\n\n>*It sort of pretends to be but doesn't make any attempt to work out what Ethereum sharding actually is so the point is clearly just to shill some Craig Wright thing. \" Edmund Edgar*\n\n**Update:** The general principle of the sharding idea I had are apparently implemented by Bitcoin Cash in 2018 and their rationale is exactly as I described it, https://www.bitcoinabc.org/2018-09-06-sharding-bitcoin-cash/. I recommend whoever controls this subreddit to reconsider making it illegal to also be interested in other projects such as Bitcoin Cash. I supported Ethereum since 2014. My well-known \"simultaneous video event\" is currently being approached by Gavin Wood who built the first version of Ethereum. It is *very disrespectful* what you are doing, and not just towards me, and it breaks more or less every social norm out there. It is very cult-like.",

    "title": "Part Six of \"Can I Pay With This?\": Trustless, My Ass",
    "selftext": "This is Part Six of the eight-part series: Can I Pay With This: A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires. Thank you to the Ethereum Foundation and the EV Mavericks for their support, without which this experiment could never have happened.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\nPart One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/) <-- New? Start here.  \n*Money, monkeys and mild terror*\n\nPart Two: [First Contact with Reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p95o9m/first_contact_with_reality_part_two_of_can_i_pay/)  \n*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*\n\nPart Three: [WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p9yafu/part_three_we_accept_bitcoin_sort_of/)  \n*Worst title for an Ethereum subreddit ever*\n\nPart Four: [Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1patml2/part_four_of_can_i_pay_with_this_eighteen_ways_to/)  \n*Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard*\n\nPart Five: [Going Bankless](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pbptyg/going_bankless_can_i_pay_with_this_part_five/)  \n*From tourist shop hack to cueva contact*\n\n**Trustless, My Ass** <-- You are here  \n*Trading with the Blue Man*\n\n---\n\nAt the hotel, the man working reception is exactly who I was hoping for: tall, broad, the build of someone who could win a bar fight just by standing up. When I sit down in the lobby, he asks if I'm meeting someone, like I need permission to sit in the hotel that I'm paying for.\n\nI say yes I am. Meeting someone. He waits, in case I'll give further details, and then shrugs and leaves me alone.\n\nOne more message to Blue Man. I'm here. Look for the blonde sitting by the window.\n\nI wait.\n\nHalf an hour passes. I look up nervously every time someone walks in.  I set up my new keyboard to have something to do with my hands. Reception man keeps one eye on me but most of his attention is taken up by the endless stream of tourists dragging too many bags.\n\nA pick-up truck pulls up outside.\n\nMy stomach flips. Is this him? Is this how it's going to happen? Am  I supposed to go out there? Is he just going to hand me an envelope after all. Am I supposed to *get in* the truck?\n\nI stay exactly where I am, mentally drafting excuses for not going outside. Anything that doesn't make me sound like a person whose first reaction to a pick-up truck is *potential kidnapping*.\n\nThe truck pulls away. Nothing to do with me.\n\nA large French family arrives and explodes across the lobby, checking in to their rooms to drop luggage and  then meeting again to go out on the town. Couples, children, cousins, an elderly woman with cataracts calling out \"Who are we  missing,\" every few minutes.\n\nHow the hell am I going to enact a dodgy transaction with Grandmère sitting next to me?\n\nEventually, the lobby clears and it is just me and the muscled man at reception. Blue Man messages, apologizes, he's finally on his way.\n\nA businessman walks in wearing a sharp suit and a tired face, checks into a room and heads for the elevator. Skinny guy wearing headphones drops a package on the desk, disappears without a word. A man with a nose that's been broken many times walks in and looks around. I tense. Muscle man behind the counter greets him like an old friend.\n\nA kid walks in, looks about thirteen. I slump back into my seat.\n\nHe turns, scans the room, sees me. His face lights up. He says my name.\n\nThis is Blue.\n\nHe is not thirteen, of course. Just young and slender. He looks like a gentle soul. Maybe writes poetry. If it came to it, I could body slam him and run.\n\nI stand. We kiss cheeks. I invite him to join me on the corner of the sofa that has been my home for the past hour. He tells me, a little nervously, that his English is not very good. I'm charmed. He holds out an envelope.\n\nI peek inside. Yes, it looks like money.\n\n\"Count it,\" he says.\n\nI pull out the bills and count them quickly. Reception man watches us, flexing, trying to work out if I'm selling my services in his hotel.\n\nPossibly I haven't thought this through. I count faster.\n\nThe amount is correct. I place the envelope next to him and set up the transaction on my phone. He pulls out his phone and shows me his list of chains, asks me again what I've chosen. I get his wallet address and send the USDT.\n\nI show him the confirmation. Blue stares at his screen.\n\n\"It takes a moment,\" he says.\n\nIt shouldn't. But I wait.\n\nA minute passes, then two. A cold feeling is just starting to creep up my spine when he makes a happy sound, shows me a Bybit notification that someone has sent him 400 USDT.\n\nBlue's using a centralized exchange.\n\nIt's none of my business. The transaction is complete. I pick up the envelope. He tells me that I can message him anytime, if I need anything. That he would be happy to do this again.\n\nI hope reception man isn't listening.\n\nThen he notices my keyboard on the table. \"Is this what you bought?\"\n\nI nod and he laughs, like who goes all the way to Buenos Aires to buy a keyboard?\n\n\"Mine  was stolen,\" I say.\n\nHe gives me another dubious look and picks it up. His face brightens into a smile. \"Oh! It's so light!\"\n\nI'm absurdly pleased that he likes my keyboard.\n\nWe say our goodbyes under the steely gaze of reception man.  And then Blue is gone.\n\n---\n\nNext: **[Custodial Services](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pg0lxi/part_seven_of_can_i_pay_with_this_custodial/)** (Self-custody is easy, luggage custody is hard)\n",

    "title": "How is Ethereum solving the blockchain trilemma? Post Fusaka upgrade analysis.",
    "selftext": "Ethereum is actively working to address the blockchain trilemma, a core challenge in the design of decentralized systems that suggests a blockchain can only achieve two of three key properties—Decentralization, Security, and Scalability—at the same time.\n\n\nEthereum's strategy involves a multi-phased roadmap and the heavy utilization of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions to tackle scalability while maintaining its core commitments to decentralization and security.\n\n🛡️ Security and Decentralization\nEthereum's foundational layer, or Layer 1 (L1), prioritizes security and decentralization, which are fundamental to its value proposition as a \"world computer.\"\n\n * Security: The network transitioned from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), known as The Merge (September 2022). PoS maintains a high level of security by making it prohibitively expensive for a malicious actor to gain enough staked ETH to compromise the network. The economic cost of an attack on Ethereum's PoS network is arguably higher than on its former PoW network.\n\n * Decentralization: PoS is intended to boost decentralization in the long run by making it easier for more people to become validators, as it requires less specialized, expensive hardware compared to PoW mining. The development roadmap also includes phases like The Scourge and The Purge, which aim to further improve censorship resistance and reduce the hardware requirements for running a node, promoting wider network participation.\n\n🚀 Scaling (Solving the Trilemma's Third Side)\n\nEthereum's main challenge was scalability—the network became congested, leading to slow transactions and high gas fees. The strategy to address this is primarily through Layer 2 solutions and fundamental L1 upgrades.\n\n1. Layer 2 (L2) Scaling Solutions\n\nEthereum leans heavily on L2 networks, which process transactions off the main chain but settle on L1, inheriting Ethereum's robust security.\n\n * Rollups: These are the most prominent L2 solution. They execute thousands of transactions off-chain and then bundle (\"roll up\") the resulting data into a single, compressed transaction that gets submitted back to the Ethereum Mainnet.\n\n   * Optimistic Rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Optimism): Assume transactions are valid but allow a \"challenge period\" where anyone can submit a fraud proof if they detect an invalid transaction.\n\n   * Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Rollups (e.g., zkSync, Starknet): Use cryptographic proofs (validity proofs) to instantly verify the correctness of off-chain transactions, providing stronger security guarantees.\n\nBy offloading the execution layer to L2s, Ethereum L1 can focus on its role as the secure and decentralized data availability layer.\n\n2. Layer 1 Upgrades\n\nEthereum's roadmap includes major L1 upgrades to support the L2 scaling strategy:\n\n * Proto-Danksharding (EIP-4844): Implemented in the Dencun upgrade (March 2024), this introduced a new, cheaper way for rollups to post transaction data to the L1 using \"blobs\". This significantly lowered L2 transaction costs, boosting scalability without compromising security or decentralization.\n\n * The Surge (Full Sharding): The long-term vision involves a form of data sharding where the network is split to handle data more efficiently. This will dramatically increase the data capacity of the L1, further scaling the L2 ecosystem to potentially handle hundreds of thousands of transactions per second (TPS).\n\nIn essence, Ethereum is solving the trilemma by adopting a layered approach: L1 provides decentralized security, and L2s provide scalability.",

It seems like it often uses something like randomly delegating from the validator pool but this (even if random) splits the consensus.\n\nAnother approach is to not split the consensus. Add an intermediary level, a \"validator manager\", and make this what is voted for with coin-vote (or people-vote). This \"validator manager\" (or maybe it could even be called \"government\") then delegates one block producer per shard. That way, each shard has the same majority consensus as any other.\n\nThe \"threads\" of a sharded blockchain have the same consensus as a single-threaded blockchain would.",

    "selftext": "Only in crypto can someone ship a whole new state architecture onto Ethereum mainnet and the collective reaction is basically “cool anyway who’s getting the next airdrop.” Anoma quietly deployed the Resource Machine and it’s honestly wild how little attention it’s getting.\n\nHere’s the part people are already getting wrong\n\n**Anoma is NOT a privacy project.**\n\nYes it has privacy baked in. Yes it uses commitments and nullifiers. Yes it uses a zkVM.\n\nBut the whole point isn’t “Zcash on Ethereum.”\n\nIt’s that Anoma is introducing a **completely different state model** that just *happens* to make privacy possible but it goes so much further.\n\nThis thing isn’t a rollup. It’s not a coprocessor. It’s not an “L2 but with extra steps.”\n\nIt’s a parallel state machine living on Ethereum. A second way to define and verify state transitions. Like if the EVM suddenly had a strange, overpowered cousin that grew up reading Zerocash papers and lifting weights with RISC0.\n\nInstead of giant mutable smart contracts, everything becomes tiny immutable resources verified with commitments and nullifiers. Off chain computation. On chain verification. Millions of private micro-objects instead of one giant public diary. The EVM suddenly looks like a 2006 Nintendo DS sitting next to this thing.\n\nAnd the apps you can build aren’t vaporware. They’re what our industry desperately needs NOW:\n\n* Private swaps that still use Uniswap liquidity\n* A private Gitcoin where your conditions stay hidden\n* Dark pools without liquidation snipers breathing down your neck\n* Private payments across any EVM chain like it’s nothing\n\nAgain none of this makes Anoma “a privacy project.” That’s like calling Ethereum “a database project.” Privacy is just a side effect of the state model. The real unlock is intent-centric apps, parallel execution, flexible off-chain computation, and a verification-first design that makes the EVM look hilariously outdated.\n\nBut the timeline is still spreadsheeting loyalty points like it’s Web2 airline rewards season.\n\nNot telling you to buy anything. Just saying a parallel state machine literally booted up inside Ethereum and most people won’t realize what that means until they see it at a multibillion FDV and suddenly “remember hearing about it early.”\n\n[https://ethresear.ch/t/the-anoma-protocol-adapter-is-live-on-ethereum/23466](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-anoma-protocol-adapter-is-live-on-ethereum/23466)",

    "title": "Going Bankless (Can I Pay With This Part Five)",
    "selftext": "This is Part Five of the eight-part series: Can I Pay With This: A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires. Thank you to the Ethereum Foundation and the EV Mavericks for their support, without which this experiment could never have happened.  \n\nPart One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/) <-- New? Start here.  \n_Money, monkeys and mild terror_  \n\nPart Two: [First Contact with Reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p95o9m/first_contact_with_reality_part_two_of_can_i_pay/)  \n_KYC on a hostel bunk bed_  \n\nPart Three: [WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p9yafu/part_three_we_accept_bitcoin_sort_of/)  \n_Worst title for an Ethereum subreddit ever_  \n\nPart Four: [Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1patml2/part_four_of_can_i_pay_with_this_eighteen_ways_to/)  \n_Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard_  \n\nPart Five: **Going Bankless** <-- You are here  \n\n---\n\n_From tourist shop hack to cueva contact_  \n\nThe problem is, if I want to transact freely here, without putting my trust into a random Web3 app created by strangers who need my KYC but don't need or want to share anything about themself, then I need cash.  \n\nI find a touristy gift shop with stickers on their window showing dollar signs and pesos. Inside is a young man with a trendy haircut and flashy clothes. He looks hip. Maybe he'll be into the future of finance?  \n\nHe confirms that he's happy to exchange money for me but looks befuddled when I mention USDT, the stablecoin pegged to the US dollar most commonly used in Argentina.  \n\n\"¿USD?\"  \n\n\"No. USD**T**,\" I insist. I have no idea how to say stablecoins. \"Digital dolares?\"  \n\nHe corrects me, _Dolares digitales_, but it still sounds like there's a question mark at the end of that.  \n\n\"Sí!\"  \n\nHe looks at me again. \"¿Y quieres cambiarlos?\" ___And you want to exchange them?___  \n\nI can't tell if he's confused by the concept or just thinks I don't look like the type to come walking into his shop talking about crypto.  \n\n\"Sí,\" I say again.  \n\nHe's still not sure. \"¿Dolares virtuales?\"  \n\nI blink. Virtual dollars sound like something you'd need for World of Warcraft. But maybe it's the better way to say it?  \n\n\"Sí,\" I say again. I am aware that I'm really not keeping up my side of this conversation.  \n\nHe thinks for a moment. \"Tell you what,\" he says in Spanish. \"What I can do is charge your card, hand you cash, you pay a little extra.\"  \n\nMy first thought: _isn't that illegal?_ But of course, so is all of this, trying to buy dollars without going through the official systems.  \n\n\"How much is a little extra?\" He gives me a rate that is slightly cheaper than Western Union and we are in agreement.  \n\nI tap my phone, he hands me cash. It feels slick, outside of the system, a benefit to both of us. I feel he understood my intent, even though he couldn't actually do the task.  \n\nIt's a cryptocard with USDT on it. Technically, I have just successfully exchanged stablecoins for cash.  Deep down, though, I know it doesn't count.  \n\nMy phone pings: Pomelo has added me to Telegram.  I immediately message back with a recap of how I am, because I'm used to my friendship circle who have the memory span of a fruit fly. I am pretty sure I'm not imagining his exasperated tone when he replies to say _Yes, I know and I'm working on it_.  \n\nIt's fine, I say breezily, I have weeks. No worries. What I really want is for him to say _Here's an address. Go there now. Don't look back_. before I lose my nerve.  \n\nArgentina has had strict foreign exchange controls since late 2011 in an attempt to stop  capital flight. By 2012, the government flat out banned buying dollars for savings. Restrictions escalated, with online shopping restricted to two parcels a year, $25 max. In 2014, the country defaulted on its debt again.The gap between the official rate and the blue rate was 90%, opening the door for the cuevas offering illicit money exchange. The stage was set for any viable alternative that could avoid government restrictions. Enter stablecoins: digital, virtual, and available to hold without having to trust the bank.  \n\nIn Argentina, and globally, if you're paying attention, trust in banks is gone. People don't hold stablecoins as a symbol of rebellion; it's a working alternate system. It might not be ideal, but it is usable.  \n\nPomelo sends me regular reassuring messages  and I'm starting  to feel like his aging aunt who needs handholding because otherwise she'll start on the gin and then all hell will break loose. That said, maybe gin isn't a bad idea.  \n\nFinally, _finally_, a whole three hours later, he sends me a name. A contact who will sell me pesos at the blue rate. He says that his friend is expecting my message.  \n\nI spend the rest of the evening staring at my phone like it might bite me. Finally, out of pure fear that I'll be one of those people who go to Argentina and write a memoir about _almost_ using crypto, I pick up the phone.  \n\nI message the Blue Man half in Spanish and half in English, not sure which language he will prefer.  \n\nI'm searching for the perfect replacement for my pink keyboard when I receive  a message from Blue Man in perfect English, confirming that Pomelo told him that I'm wanting to buy pesos, and how much?  \n\nSuddenly, this isn't a thought experiment anymore. Someone on the other end of a screen is offering to hand me cash, in a city I barely know, in exchange for something that we can't touch.  \n\nHe sends me a link, today's rate. Tells me USDT only. I ask which chain. There's a pause.  \n\nIt sounds like a small thing, but it's not. I want this trade to happen in the context of Ethereum. Tether—USDT—is on nearly every chain now but in Argentina it's commonly used on TRON. Cheap fees, fast transfers, but the ecosystem around it feels like a second-hand suit: functional but a little grimy. I've already decided  that if he won't do ERC-20 stablecoin transfer, I'm out.  \n\nTo my relief, Blue Man sends a screenshot from his wallet. Yes, TRON and SOL are at the top but also ERC-20 options: Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Polygon. I stand in the street, phone in hand, trying to get USDT on Arbitrum and then I think, to hell with it. I already have $300 USDT sitting on mainnet, easier just to swap another $100 and eat the gas fees rather than keep chasing some hyperoptimized elegant solution that no one else cares about.  \n\nNow that we are in technical agreement, Blue Man asks where I am so that he can bring me the cash. I tell him I'm wandering  lost trying to find a shop that will sell me a USB keyboard that I don't hate with the passion of a thousand suns, but once I've done  that, I'll meet him anywhere. Bonus points if there's coffee.  \n\nI'm still staring at my phone when I bump into someone. The sidewalk is jammed with people, locals queuing up at a nondescript red doorway. No name, no music, just the smell of hot oil and a chalkboard with today's specials.  \n\nI join them.  \n\nWhen it's my turn to walk inside, I find I'm in a tiny room with chairs up against a thin table on one side and a counter on the other   where multiple people are dishing out meals. Tucked in by the doorway is a creased-face old man running the till with practiced precision: cash, card, QR.  \n\nI ask for lentils, one of the specials.  \n\n\"We don't have lentils,\" he tells me.  \n\n\"Oh.\" I have no Plan B. I stand there, lost, an anathema to his fast-moving system.  \n\n\"We didn't make them,\" he tells me. \"It's too hot.\"  \n\n\"But I like them,\" I say meekly, as if we are having a conversation.  \n\nHe glares at me. I lean to get view of the chalkboard and blurt out the only other thing that I can see. \"Albondigas con arroz.\" I do not  understand why it is too hot for lentils and not too hot for meatballs with rice but no one else seems concerned.  \n\nThe man scribbles the price on a small piece of paper and hands it to me. I shove it in my pocket, grumpy that he doesn't trust me to understand the numbers. \"I'll pay by QR,\" I say, like I'm a local just masquerading like a  lost tourist.  \n\nHe waves me to the counter, a narrow area crammed with hungry office workers and freelancers looking ready to make their next deal. The man behind the counter is moving fast, handing out plates of food. Then he barks for the next person to give him their order.  \n\nWith horror, I realise that I have to hand over the scribbled number on a slip: it wasn't for *me*, it was for this guy. I hand him my rumpled slip and ask for meatballs to eat here, perching on a high stool.  \n\nA  few minutes later,  he slides a plate towards me, heaped with rice and three large meatballs.  \n\n \"Albondigas para dos,\" he says.  \n\n\"No, no.\"  This is meatballs for two, and I'm only me, I  say, confusedly.  \n\nHe pauses, his face creased with concern. What's wrong? Do I not wan this?  \n\nI'm breaking the system again. \"_Soy sola_,\" I say, I'm alone, and then spot my mistake. I think I just informed the guy that I'm single.  \n\nHe holds my gaze.  \n\nNo one else claims the plate. And who the hell serves three meatballs for two people. Never mind, I tell  him. It's fine. Don't worry.  \n\nHe frowns and then flies back into chaotic motion, taking orders, handing out the results. I'm halfway through my meal when I hear it again: his voice, handing a takeaway box to someone else. _Para vos_. For you. Singular. Direct. Only in Argentina.  \n\nEven the simplest of interactions are fraught for me here. I pull out my phone to get my next instruction from Blue Man.  \n\nHis text says I don't need to come to him. Finish my shopping. He can send a motorbike courier to me.  \n\nThis is not what I expected.  \n\nI thought that we would meet in some indoor back room.  Some fluorescent-lit space with a counter and chairs and CCTV. And witnesses. I remember my hostel manager: never make transaction on the street.  \n\nI ask him straight: I meet a guy on a motorbike who just... pays me?  \n\nYes, exactly. Once the funds hit the Blue Man's wallet, motorbike man will hand me the envelope.  \n\nAn envelope. Could be anything. Receipts. Cut-up newspapers. A polite threat. And how is motorbike man going to know that the money went through?  \n\nI don't like any of this.  \n\nI message back that I need to know the envelope actually has money in it. Before I do the transaction. I admit that I don't know how  to do this in a trustless way.  \n\nThere is no problem, he tells me. His very good friend Pomelo recommended him to me, he reminds me. This is meant to represent trust.  \n\nI message Pomelo: is he actually a very good friend? Would he trust him with cash?  \n\nAt the same time I message Blue Man again. Pomelo is not *my* good friend. He's just some guy I met in an  ice cream shop.  \n\nSomewhere between all this, I find a keyboard. It's not pink but it will do.  \n\nI want to point out to Blue Man that I'm a woman alone, in a foreign city, explain why this setup is starting to feel physically dangerous.  But he already knows that I'm a foreigner. Assumes I don't speak Spanish. My real name. He knows a hell of a lot more about me than I do about him. There really isn't anything I can add to that.  \n\nA message from Pomelo. Yes, this is a real friend and yes, he'd trust him.  They could be in this together, of course. But Pomelo is plugged into the local Ethereum scene. He has a reputation. Something to lose.  \n\nBlue Man is waiting. I stall. Tell him that I'm looking for a place to meet the courier. \"As long as I can see the cash first,\" I text, \"we're good.\"  \n\nI find a place to sit in the middle of the avenue, the Obelisk towering above me, and try to think this through.  \n\nI've moved from my hostel room to a dingy hotel on the other side of the Avenida. Motorbike guy could meet me there. Not my room—god no—but in the lobby. The front desk is staffed by a guy who looks like personal protection, with arms the size of my thighs.  \n\nIf it goes sideways with motorbike guy, he might not take my side. He might not even look up. But it's indoors, big windows, a busy street. CCTV, probably.  \n\nI don't care about my stuff. If the burner phone gets grabbed, it doesn't matter. The wallet is synched elsewhere. I have already learned where to buy a keyboard. What I need is at least a hint of physical protection. I am not actually able to put my trust into strangers with pseudonyms and cash in envelopes.  \n\nI send Blue Man a screenshot of $400 in pesos pegged to the blue rate. It's up ten pesos since this morning. He offers a round number, asks if I want large bills or small. He's happy with the lobby. He's going to come personally, he tells me, so that I can feel more comfortable.  \n\nThis means that Blue Man will know where I'm staying, not just some guy on a motorbike. But at this point, I'm out of ideas.  \n\nAnother message from Blue Man. \"Can we do this now?\"  \n\nI tell him I'll be there in twenty.  \n\n---  \n\nUp next is Part Six: **[Trustless, My Ass](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pf4r51/part_six_of_can_i_pay_with_this_trustless_my_ass/)** (Trading with the Blue Man)\n",

    "title": "Part Four of Can I Pay With This?: Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream",
    "selftext": "This is Part Four of the eight-part series: *Can I Pay With This: A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires*. Thank you to the Ethereum Foundation and the EV Mavericks for their support, without which this experiment could never have happened.\n\n*Catch up here:*\n\nPart One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/)  \n*Money, monkeys and mild terror*\n\nPart Two: [First Contact with Reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p95o9m/first_contact_with_reality_part_two_of_can_i_pay/)  \n*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*\n\nPart Three: [WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p9yafu/part_three_we_accept_bitcoin_sort_of/)  \n*OK, that was the worst title for an Ethereum subreddit ever*\n\n**Part Four: Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream** <-- You are here  \n*Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard*\n\n*---*\n\nMy first real encounter with hyperinflation comes with breakfast. I've been frequenting a bakery on  Avenida de Mayo for their breakfast combo: A cup of coffee with two tiny croissant-like things stuffed with ham and cheese. Last week, the price was 6,000 pesos. This week, it's 8,200.\n\nI realize with a start that nowhere in this city have I seen a printed price. They are all on chalkboards or handwritten with ballpoint pen on menus that have been updated several times already.\n\nNo one but me expects things to cost the same this week as they did last week.\n\nI'm converting small amounts of money every time to motivate me to try harder to find a way to get cash for stablecoins. The actual result is that I keep running out of cash.\n\nI've been told not to use ATMs as they charge an exorbitant fee but I'm willing to pay a fee in this case, or at least find out what it is.  I find a bank with an ATM which seems like the most likely bet and tap my card. It's accepted and I have a few options for withdrawing cash, from 10,000 pesos to 50,000 pesos. That's not a lot. I tap 50,000 pesos. An error. That is over my daily limit. I back up and check my bank. Nope. Nowhere near my daily limit. This is a limit from the cash machine, not from my side.\n\nI go back to the machine and work my way down the list. 50, 40, 30. Finally, it agrees that I may have 30,000 pesos, about twenty dollars, but only if I pay a $7 transaction fee. I politely decline. Obnoxiously, the charge shows up as pending on my card despite my backing out: the funds are released the following day.\n\nI have learned my lesson about ATMs.\n\nBinance and Bybit advertisements are posted all over the city, bold and bright like emergency exits. These are centralized exchanges, the easy way to hold crypto. Instead of having a crypto wallet, the exchanges hold your funds for you. It's centralized, permissioned, requires full trust in the exchange to do right by you and to continue existing.  Trading trust in banks for loosely regulated financial institutions. In Argentina, this is not necessarily a bad decision.\n\nOver my coffee, I scan for crypto news. *El Submarino Jujuy*, a provincial news site, has a long detailed piece on how to monitor five simultaneous exchange rates:  official, blue, MEP, CCL and crypto dollars. What surprises me is how little explanation there is. The article assumes that the reader already has an exchange account, already holds ETH and BTC. There's no explanation of wallets or blockchains, only strategy. I cannot imagine an article like this in *The Guardian* or *The New York Times*, unless it had a sidebar on \"The mythology of crypto\" and a quote from a distressed 60-something who lost everything.\n\nAnd yet, while we are excited about smart contracts, leverage and liquidity protocols, most people here don't seem to be talking about trading. They're holding stablecoins, not for yield, not for innovation, but simply to avoid erosion.  They are content to use centralized exchange cards, converting at checkout, side-stepping the crumbling peso.\n\nI do it too. Tapping my cards and scanning my QR apps for as many transactions as possible so I can limit my exposure to the peso.\n\n\"May I?\" An old man wants the other half of my table. He looks me over. \"Where are you from?\"\n\nI tell him.\n\nHe nods knowingly and then asks, \"Is that Occidental or Oriental?\"\n\nThis is not a question that I was expecting.  \"Occidental, I think?\"\n\nHe nods again, as if he knew that all along.\n\nWhen I go back to my phone, I get a lucky break—an event posted to Twitter: Stablecoin Ice Cream. A challenge to meet at Crecimiento to descend on the best heladería in Buenos Aires. \"Let's buy some ice cream using ONLY stablecoins.\" I sign up immediately.\n\nThere are prizes for the best and worst FX rate. More people add more prizes, including 1000% cashback for using WalletConnect to pay for your ice cream The organizer thought probably no one would come. In the end, eighteen of us show up and he's slightly panicked that he didn't warn the ice cream shop.\n\nThe server does his best to cope with a slightly feral crowd of crypto enthusiasts descending on him on a Friday afternoon. Someone convinces him to install a Settle wallet so that they can transact in USDC for the ice cream. It almost works until the owner intervenes and insists: pesos only.\n\nWe each choose two scoops of ice cream. I get spicy mango and pistachio, which turns out to be an inspired combination.\n\nI scan the QR code to pay with Peanut. It fails. I switch to my trusty crypto card, which works. Someone else tries to scan the QR code with their Metamask wallet app, which doesn't. We test Peanut (which works for everyone else), Gnosis Pay, Yodl, Ready (Starknet), Redot. Quite a few give up and pay in cash.\n\nThe organizer posts an update on Twitter:\n\n>50% of participants who are actually working in 9-5 jobs in web3 today couldn't pay with stablecoin on-chain.\n\nThe FX rate varies by application but also by when the ice cream as bought, with noticeable volatility even on the same wallets over the half hour we took to order.\n\nI win a prize for the third-worst FX rate: 25 $BOND tokens. Now I have to find out what $BOND is.\n\nNo one claims the 1000% cash back for using WalletConnect. No one can work out how.\n\nBut it's a success. I have another two apps to try. A third, Luca, is tackling exactly the problem that I was thinking about: onboarding regular people to deposit their savings in stablecoins to gain yield from DeFi, with no need to understand any of the machinery.\n\nI explain about trying to use crypto in Buenos Aires,  that I've still not seen any way to buy pesos with stablecoins.\n\n\"Why do you want to?\" I have DeFi cards. I have an app that scans QR codes. I can pay seamlessly in restaurants and ice cream shops and kiosks. The transaction goes through and boom, it's on-chain, final, and the grocer gets paid. What more do I want?\n\nAnd I'm still stuck on the idea of pure decentralization. An actual wallet-to-wallet transaction. I don't care what I buy: pesos or empanadas or a late night glass of wine. I just want to cut out the middleman. Decentralized. Permissionless. Trustless.\n\nI mean technically, yes, it's permissionless. No one can stop me from  submitting a transaction to a street vendor. I can sign it. It'll show up on a block explorer.\n\nBut I can't force the street vendor to accept my transaction and give me empanadas.  You can't route around human consent.\n\nI feel stupid explaining how confused I feel about all this, so instead, I try to be amusing by telling  them the story of buying candy with BCH.\n\nAn Argentine with a cone holding two identical scoops of pink-orange ice cream explains to me that to trade stablecoins for pesos, you need a friend who knows a friend. \"That's how it works in Buenos Aires.\"\n\nSomeone murmurs *cuevas* in the background. He nods, that's what he's talking about. Blackmarket  traders. They no longer operate in actual caves, I've read, just secret spaces. Tiny, nondescript back offices, hidden behind the magazine racks inside a news kiosk, in the back of a lingerie shop, or up a dodgy elevator in an old building. It's exactly what I am wondering about. It sounds scary.\n\nI also wonder: What kind of lunatic gets two scoops of ice cream and then only chooses one flavor? He tells me that it's all *pomelo*, grapefruit, and that he has no regrets.\n\n\"So,\" I say, trying to look cool about asking the Pomelo-loving-man half my age for underground stablecoin hookups in an ice cream shop. \"Do you have a friend?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\nAnd just like that, I have a way forward. I will either make good on my challenge or get murdered in a Buenos Aires back alley. Luckily, I don't have enough crypto to be worth murdering, which even the most greedy bad guy can guess from my faded jeans and sweat-shop t-shirts that I've been hand-washing in the sink.\n\nI find Pomelo again before the event ends, refusing to risk his disappearing into the shadows of Subte Línea D. I hand him a business card. \"It has my email address,\" I explain.\n\nHe looks at me like I just gave him a fax number. \"Don't you have Telegram?\"\n\nOf course I do, yes, and he promises to add me as a contact.\n\nIt's not a big deal though, Pomelo warns me. It sounds like it's pretty shady but really it isn't.\n\n\"I just want to be able to say that I've done it,\" I tell him. I promise that I'm not expecting anything cloak and dagger.\n\nHe'll be in touch, he says.\n\nI try not to show how excited I am.\n\nThe following day is Pride and Avenida de Mayo is a glorious chaos of queer, cocktails, drums, glitter and screaming. I bounce through the crowds all afternoon, sipping Fernet and Coke and trying to pretend  like it doesn't taste like cough syrup.\n\nLater, walking back through Microcentro on a piece of sidewalk just wide enough for one polite person, I feel something brush the top of my head. I stop, look up, look back, reach into my hair like a chimp checking for lice.\n\nTwo men and a woman, walking tightly together, pass me. As they do, the woman says something low and quick in Spanish, too fast to understand, too deliberate to ignore. I think she's telling what's in my hair and I'm mostly hoping that it isn't bird shit. But I'm also thrown. She's not smiling. She's not trying to be helpful.\n\nI pat my head a bit more, finding nothing. As I continue, I see the same trio standing in a doorway, talking. As I pass, they fall in behind me again. I'm still wondering what the woman said to me, and why.\n\nIt's not until I am back in my room that I realise my back pocket is empty.  I have been pickpocketed.\n\nThey stole my pink keyboard.\n\n---\n\n**[Part Five: Going Bankless](https://old.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1pbptyg/going_bankless_can_i_pay_with_this_part_five/)** (From tourist shop hack to cueva contact)",

    "title": "Part Three: WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)",
    "selftext": "This is Part Three of the eight-part series: **Can I Pay With This: A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires**.\n\nThank you to the Ethereum Foundation and the EV Mavericks for their support, without which this experiment could never have happened.\n\nPart One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/)  \n*Money, monkeys and mild terror*\n\nPart Two: [First Contact with Reality](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p95o9m/first_contact_with_reality_part_two_of_can_i_pay/)  \n*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*\n\n**Part Three: WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)** <-- you are here  \n*My first on-chain candy*\n\nThe more I dig through the smoldering ruins of Argentina's last thirty years of fiscal misadventure, the clearer it gets.\n\nStablecoins aren't a tech flex, they are life rafts. People aren't clinging to centralized exchanges like Binance and Bybit because they don't understand DeFi. They are doing it because they've already lived through hyperinflation, default,and enough broken promises to wallpaper the presidential suite in the Casa Rosada. *Decentralization* sounds like a luxury item when your savings are vaporizing during your morning commute.\n\nAs I enter the pedestrian streets of Calles Florida and Lavalle, the chorus of shouts offering to exchange dollars for pesos underscores my thoughts.  People don't trust banks and for good reason. In 2001, the government froze bank accounts. Overnight, everyone lost access to their life savings.\n\nIn most of the world, we're still trying to explain what a stablecoin *is*. Here, trust has already migrated away from governments and banks, to USDT, USDC, DAI, and whatever else has a shot at holding its value overnight.  The challenge isn't crypto adoption; it's building trustless tools that are as easy and reliable as the rickety-but-working systems they already rely on.\n\nI'm halfway through congratulating myself on this insight when the view through a large shop stops me cold. *La Golosinería* is a brightly lit hellscape of Halloween kitsch with boxes of candies piled high among displays of plastic pumpkins in nuclear-orange and pitch-black. But what stops me is a paper print out near the check-out with the words WE ACCEPT BITCOIN with the Bitcoin Cash symbol lurking underneath.\n\nBitcoin split in 2017 in a public meltdown with no chance of reconciliation. BTC promised security by staying with smaller blocks and  slower speeds. BCH stormed off in a huff to develop bigger blocks to lower fees and speed up transactions, which would make it actually viable to use it on a day-to-day basis.  Both are very clear that they represent Satoshi's actual vision. Both call themselves Bitcoin.\n\nFunnily enough, I own exactly two Bitcoin Cash tokens, as the person who got me into crypto insisted it was technically superior. BTC is trading over $100,000 per token. BCH? About $500. I've kept the tokens  for sentimental reasons.\n\nThat evening, out of some sort of mix of curiosity and masochism, I set up a Bitcoin.com wallet on my burner phone and move a twentieth of a Bitcoin Cash token over, around $25. I'm not sure how much Halloween candy I need to buy to avoid looking like I am trying to launder digital money in a candy store.\n\nThe next  morning, I lose my way in the Buenos Aires subway system for over an hour, long enough to wonder if I might never surface again, living below the surface on churros and dread. After several laps of confusion, I emerge into daylight and find my way back to La Golosinería. I rifle through the sugar bombs and gummy worms looking for something vaguely healthy and get into line.Argentines, God bless them, are absolute professionals at standing in line.\n\nOne queue. Three tills. Nobody cuts. No chaos.\n\nExcept for me.\n\nThere are three clerks working the tills: two women looking like they've seen too many candy seasons and one disturbingly enthusiastic kid who looks much too happy to be working in a Halloween shop the day before Halloween. He is stationed nearest the WE ACCEPT BITCOIN sign. Target acquired.\n\nI step in and out of the line, pretending to suddenly care deeply about boxed nougat imported from  Spain, ignoring the dirty looks from the rest of the queue.\n\nIt works.\n\nThe kid smiles like he's won a prize for just existing and scans my candy. “Dos mil setecientos pesos.” 2,700 pesos.\n\nI tap the curling printout taped to the wall. \"Is it true that I can pay with Bitcoin cash?\"\n\n\"Yes, you can!\" He looks very proud until he realizes that I actually intend to do so. \"Of course, of course you can, no problem.\" Each repetition a little less  convincing.\n\nHe ducks behind the counter to fiddle with something unseen, probably to generate a BCH QR code. Whatever he's trying to do, it's not happening.\n\nHe turns to the woman at the next till to ask for help, pointing to the unseen device. She doesn't even look at it. She has no idea and she doesn't care.\n\nShe turns to me. \"Can't you just pay with Mercado Pago?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I say, smiling my most sincere smile. \"But I want to try this.\"\n\nShe sighs and goes back to her customer, her patience exhausted.\n\nBut the kid, bless him, is invested. He's in too deep to give up now. He calls someone, breathlessly explaining that he has a customer that wants to pay with Bitcoin and what the hell does he do?\n\nHe listens, nods, looks  at me with renewed purpose. He tells me to scan the QR code on the Bitcoin sign. It opens a confirmation screen asking me if  I'd like to transact with a completely different business name and how much I want to to transfer.\n\nOh god, it's in US dollars.\n\n\"How much is it in dollars?\"\n\nHe has no idea and no way is he asking the woman for help again.\n\n\"OK. Give me a sec.\" I find the currency selector. Argentina is at the top. I type in 2,700 ARS.\n\n\"Wait, wait wait!\" He stops me. \"Don't send it yet.\"\n\nHe's back on the phone, talking it through. I hover, tapping my screen to keep it from fading.\n\nMore conversation and then he's back. \"Now. Now, yes. Now you can send it.\"\n\nHe leans in to watch as I press the button. I turn the phone to him to show him that the transaction is successful.\n\nHe's back on the phone. \"She sent it! Did you get it?\" A pause and he hands over the candy like I'm some overaged trick-or-treater at his door. \"He got it!\"\n\nWe have achieved a successful blockchain transaction.\n\nMy BCH haul:\n\n* Pipas mini crack fuego\n* Bull Dog regaliz, sabor sandia\n* Spicy honey roasted maní desde el campo\n\nI have proven that if I have to live off of crypto alone in Buenos Aires, I will not starve.\n\nAs I step out into the street, I consider that this still doesn't quite fit my objective of a decentralised  purchase without a middle man. Because ... the kid was clearly on the phone speaking to the person with the Bitcoin Cash wallet. Three people are needed to buy 2,700 worth of snacks: me, the BCH person and the kid in the middle.\n\nI cross the massive Avenida 9 de Julio, passing under the shadow of the Obelisk. The texture of the neighborhood changes. The shops thin out. There are people but very few tourists. It doesn't feel dangerous but definitely quieter. Grittier.\n\nI stop to take a photo of a crumbling building with ivy crawling over the cracks. Behind me, I hear someone  stumble to a halt. A man, too close, turns and leans against the wall, staring across the  street, like there is something very important over there.\n\nI look across the street to see what caught his interest. A shuttered shop front. A parked car. A plastic bag flutters in the gutter.\n\nMy half-mumbled apology for stopping in front of him dies on my lips. If he were just some random pedestrian, he would've kept walking. Or glared. Or grunted and sidestepped. Not...stopped.\n\nI look back at the man but he's gone.\n\n\\---\n\nPart Four: [Eighteen Ways to Pay for Ice Cream](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1patml2/part_four_of_can_i_pay_with_this_eighteen_ways_to/) (Stablecoins, FX hell and a missing keyboard).",

    "title": "First Contact with Reality (Part Two of Can I Pay With This?)",
    "selftext": "This is Part Two of the eight-part series: *Can I Pay With This? A stablecoin experiment in Buenos Aires*\n\nThank you to the Ethereum Foundation and the EV Mavericks for their support, without which this experiment could never have happened.\n\nPart One: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/)  \n*Money, monkeys and mild terror*\n\n**Part Two: First Contact with Reality** <-- you are here  \n*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*\n\n\n\nI arrive in Buenos Aires and immediately discover that Twitter has lied to me. Various digital nomads had insisted that there was no need for cash in Buenos Aires anymore. Don't bother bringing dollars or euros.\n\nIt is true that Argentina is currently in a period of relative exchange stability after years of crippling inflation (for ex, 211% in 2023). Using a foreign credit or debit card then meant you'd get the terrible *Official Rate*. In reality, everyone used the black market *Blue Rate* which at times could give you almost double as many pesos for your dollars. But now that the two rates have converged, the  Twitterati explained, it is safe to use your cards again.\n\nI believed them. Now I have regrets.\n\nThe taxi app crashes; the driver is happy to take me anyway for the original amount or even a discount, but he will only accept pesos in cash. My hostel wants a cash deposit for the towel. The first coffee shop I walk into has a big sign: We do not take cards. The man at the subway won't let me top up my newly acquired SUBTE card unless I handed over cash pesos. Not to mention restaurants offering discounts ranging from 10% to an eyewatering 25%  just for paying with actual paper money. And let's not talk about the obvious scowls if I even *think* about tipping my server using my card.\n\nI need to find out how to get cash, fast.\n\nThe hostel owner gives the same lecture to every new arrival. Yes, you can get pesos on the black market. However, here are the neighbourhoods that you must not enter if you value your life. Keep your money in your pocket whenever you are outside. Don't take selfies unless you want to lose your phone.\n\nHe shrugs confusedly when I ask if I can trade stablecoins for pesos. I need dollars, he tells me.\n\nOnce he's convinced that I'm taking him seriously, he gives me directions to a man in a jewelry shop whom he trusts, who will buy my Euros. Don't trade with anyone outside on the street, he tells me. It's dangerous. I can pay the towel deposit later, don't worry. Just be safe! Don't trade on the street.\n\nThe streets in question, Calles Lavalle and Florida, are full of men and women calling cambio, cambio, cambio de dolares! every few meters. Mindful of the hostel advice, I ignore them and walk to the jewelry store. A man outside asks if I want to trade and waves me into the tiny shop with an old man sitting with a large cash register. Watches of various values are laid out on the counter.\n\nWhen I ask if they take stablecoins, he actually laughs. I try again: What about debit cards? Only if I wanted to buy a watch.\n\nI trade 50 euro for many tens of thousands of pesos. I feel conspicuous carrying this much cash, unsafe. I try not to look vulnerable.\n\nI'm crossing a road when a guy walking towards me passes too closely, brushing my shoulder. There was plenty of room and no reason for it. I turn to see who bumped into me and discover he's turned too, standing a few meters behind me, staring at me. As our eyes lock, he turns again and walks away.\n\nThat evening, another resident tells me that he didn't bother with the owner's instructions. It was easy to get pesos, he says. \"I just walked up to some guy on the street and handed him $500.\"\n\nPeer to peer, yes. But I think I'm not that brave.\n\nI unpack my three T-shirts and two Android phones and a tablet and a keyboard for the tablet and another travel keyboard, a cute little pink thing that folds up, which I keep in the back pocket of my hoodie, so it is easy access to pull out and use with my phone in coffee shops.\n\nThe next assignment: wrestle with a pile of Argentine Web3 apps promoted by Devconnect to showcase Argentine innovation.\n\nThey aren't wrong. Argentina is certainly punching above its weight when it comes to Web3 development. There's an almost romantic backstory there, going back to innovation hubs like *Casa Voltaire* (2014-2016) which led to actual, very-real projects such as Decentraland and OpenZeppelin. Today, Argentina ranks second in Latin America for Web3 developers, despite having only a fraction of the population of Brazil or Mexico. Grassroots communities such as Ethereum Argentina and Crecimiento are dedicated to transforming the country into LATAM's crypto capital.\n\nBut when I download the apps, I discover that they are not for meant for me.\n\nLemon Cash and Belo require a national identity number from a South American country. Ripio lists six countries, including Mexico and - unexpectedly - USA residents and non-residents. As a non-resident of the USA, I start filling in their form, which happily accepts my Euro-credentials and then asks me to upload a copy of my W8BEN, which is essentially the IRS asking you to declare that you are *not* an American, so they can find some other way to punish you. I back out quietly and delete the app.\n\nThe tablet's keyboard fails on the first day, the bluetooth connection hiccupping and disconnecting. The smaller pink keyboard will work for both phone and tablet, however, and I feel smug that I have built-in redundancy. I get back to work with barely a hitch.\n\nI see someone talking about payment solutions on the DevConnect Telegram channel. A new batch of Web3 apps with an elegant premise: use a stablecoin wallet to pay merchants who use the QR-code system in Argentina. Grocery stores, pharmacies and little kiosks that sell novelty mate mugs all accept QR payments, in a system regulated by the Central Bank of Argentina under the *Tranferencias 3.0* initiative. It's not quite escaping traditional finance, but the initiative requires that all payment service providers and banks use the same standardized QR code generator. The Web3 apps plug into the QR scaffolding that already exists, allowing me to hold stablecoins (USDC or USDT, depending on the app) and spend in pesos.\n\nKYC is required to comply with local regulations. I quickly try Peanut and Yodl, which both offer QR payments for Argentina and Brazil, Yodl also works in Vietnam and the Philippines.  To my surprise, the Know Your Customer (KYC) isn't completely soul-crushing. I enter my address, upload my passport screenshot and minutes later I can move money into my wallet using one of a number of Ethereum Layer 2s designed to make transactions faster and cheaper. Both use Arbitrum, which is a relief. Peanut wants USDC, Yodl wants USDT .\n\nThis isn't to say that I was happy with KYC as a part of my solution. This is the requirement to collect personal identifying data to ensure that you, as a provider, can prove that you  \"know your customer\".  KYC regulations require that financial applications collect information about their users in order to reduce money laundering and financial fraud, despite billions poured into compliance yearly with little noticeable impact, if any.\n\nAn additional catch is that many applications use KYC as an excuse to collect additional data or to filter out customers that they don't like. KYC info is often used as an anti-sybil measure. Ether.fi rejected me because I live in a country that they don't want to deal with. And I'm still feeling salty about going through KYC with Monerium when it was in beta, who then informed me that I couldn't have an account because I wasn't notable enough. I am apparently too boring for the future of finance.\n\nBut also... this KYC is easy for me because I'm exactly who financial systems want to offer accounts to. I have a passport from a country that matters, my name linked to an address that exists on official forms, documentation proving I am who I claim to be. I thought that part of the point of alternative finance was to help those people that banks won't or can't serve.\n\nMeanwhile, I'm sitting cross-legged on a hostel bunk, surrounded by charging cables, relying on the hostel's Wi-Fi signal remaining strong enough to upload another photograph of my passport. The future of finance still seems to require centralized government approval.\n\nAnother issue: So far, everything I've looked at makes me transfer my money from my wallet to theirs. I instinctively want to say that they are custodial. But no: the apps *all* say that they are self-custodial, which is confusing the hell out of me. I can't link my own wallet. I have to send funds from *my* wallet to a wallet in their app. How is that self-custody?\n\nPeanut uses passkeys, saved with Apple or Google, rather than trusting me to store my own details. There is no way to gain control of the wallet they create on my behalf. Their docs insist that it is self-custodial because they don't actually hold the funds and can't spend them on my behalf. I can kinda see the argument, if what they mean is that thewallet is *not custodial*. But I don't think \"we can't spend your money for you\" is what *self-custody* means.\n\nYodl seems better in this regard: they generate an embedded wallet using Privy and apparently it is possible to gain control of the wallet by bypassing Yodl and using Privy options to export your keys. I have no idea how to do this and I had to wade through their terms and conditions to even find that information.\n\nNeither app has any option for exporting the wallet or any option at all, other than to submit a transaction to withdraw the funds to another wallet. There are no details on recovery. As of right now, if they disappear overnight, so does my money.\n\nOn the other hand, I understand that they want to make their apps straight-forward. I appreciate that these middlemen are the only reason that I can buy empanadas without explaining smart contracts to a bakery.  They are connecting Web3 to meatspace by plugging into an existing QR system, which is truly useful. I distinctly feel that they don't  *want* to be gatekeepers, they want to be guides.\n\nBut it doesn't feel right. I'm learning that sometimes words in DeFi don't mean what I think they mean.\n\nI consider renaming my challenge. *Decentralized-ish with bonus Customer Support or Destitute except for a wallet full of cash and three cards* .\n\n\\---\n\nCan I Pay With This?\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\nPart 1: [Decentralized or Destitute](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p85ooe/part_one_of_can_i_pay_with_this_a_stablecoin/)  \n*Money, monkeys and mild terror*\n\nPart 2: First Contact with Reality <-- you are here  \n*KYC on a hostel bunk bed*\n\n**Next up**: [WE ACCEPT BITCOIN (sort of)](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/s/3lwYtN7pjK)",

    "title": "Honest Opinions About Crypto Games",
    "selftext": "So crypto games have a bad rap in mainstream because of past scams. Also, a lot of them get criticized because of the poor gameplay quality, and because of the fact that they focus more on earning rather than the actual gameplay mechanics (which I agree with). \n\nHowever, using crypto seems beneficial because you can track all of the transactions on the blockchain online (nothing is hidden). If, for example, you do an esports type of tournament with a cash prize pool given to players, you can literally track how that pool is given to players on the blockchain. But without crypto, you have to trust the companies on how the pool is being distributed (because you don't know what their doing behind the scene). Also, the transaction fees with some crypto chains are pretty low (in the milli-cents, compared to using credit cards to buy in-game virtual currencies, like Fortnite VBucks)...\n\nBut the fact that crypto games haven't taken off tells me that gamers really don't care about transparency and fees...They trust the centralized gaming companies/publishers, and are willing to pay premiums for skins and other in-game assets without being the true owners of those assets. \n\nAs gamers, do you guys agree with this?\n\nDo you see any case where gamers would prefer to transition to crypto instead of traditional credit card systems?",

The economy is feral. Enter crypto.\n\nDevconnect 2025, the World's Fair for Ethereum, will be (or has been, by the time you are reading this) held in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\n>Argentina is a place where Ethereum adoption is happening *right now*. People are using stablecoins and blockchain solutions for daily transactions and savings.\n\nLike many people interested in the culture of Ethereum, I have only scratched the surface of Decentralized Finance. DeFi, ranging from yield-bearing accounts to leverage trading to penguin NFTs. Ethereum, I'm told, is digital oil, the beginnings of a system that will change the way we interact with finance the way that the Internet has changed the way we interact with the world.\n\nIt sounds amazing and futuristic: a sci-fi utopia. But right here, right now, the Ethereum Foundation says that people in Buenos Aires are using these solutions to buy coffee and bread and maybe a little salvation.\n\nCould I do that, too? Could I buy asado and wine with stablecoins? Toilet paper?\n\nI decide that I need to find out. I'll fly to Argentina and see if I could live on-chain, converting my carefully hoarded store of half an ETH to USDC.\n\nThere's three parts to this. Decentralized: No single entity is in control. Permissionless: I cannot be denied access. Trustless: I don't need to have faith that the transaction will happen.\n\nHow close can I get to that dream of the future of finance of walking the sunlit streets with nothing but a digital wallet and my own hunger?\n\nI call the challenge *Decentralized or Destitute*.\n\nI pack a backpack with three T-shirts, one pair of jeans and a cheap phone to hold a burner wallet.  Also two debit cards, one credit card and an envelope full of cash. Because I am not brave and I've seen what happens to idealists in documentaries.\n\nStep one: get a place to sleep using crypto.\n\nBooking an apartment directly with a private owner fails immediately. The first person I contact rejects the offer without consideration. *\"No cripto.\"* Dollar, Euros or Pesos, but absolutely cash only. The second not only doesn't want crypto but doesn't want my business at all, just for asking.\n\nI'm going to have to use one of the travel platforms that offer this specifically.\n\nUnfortunately, the great savings of up to 60% off for paying with crypto are based on booking hotels of a slightly higher quality than I usually stay at. One excitedly tells me about the perfect place for me! And it's 44% off! Making for a very affordable $619.50 per night with 2% cashback. There seem to be very few options at my actual price range, which is more like $40 a night. Preferably with walls.\n\nBetrustly, a brand new booking platform designed for Argentina, gives me hope. I find a perfect room in a large co-living house: private bathroom, working areas, fantastic price and available for the dates I wanted. Except that I never receive a response. Customer support's advice is to book the place directly. They quickly reply to my direct contact: application only, the minimum stay is one month, and no, they do not take crypto.\n\nThe Ether.fi travel portal finally gives me a  break: a private room that actually exists, well-placed, well-priced.\n\nBut when they say you can pay in crypto, they don't mean that you can pay in crypto. You have to have an Ether.fi card for that perk. Fine, I apply for  the card. No. People who live in my country are not invited to the party.\n\nDesperate for a solution, I cave and pay with a DeFi card: it's Gnosis Pay, which is self-custodial (they can't lock me out of my finds) and allows me to pay for my hostel booking with stablecoins. Technically a win.  But Gnosis Pay is a *Visa card*. A literal, physical card indistinguishable from the one issued by my bank. It feels like I won using training wheels and corporate logos.\n\nFriends and family express only minor concern at my plan. My best friend worries I'll get indoctrinated into a crypto cult. (Plausible.) My mother thinks that I might be in over my head. (Correct.) My aunt is concerned that I might have fallen for a romance scam. (Incorrect, but my DMs are open.)\n\nBut to my surprise, the most urgent concerns for my safety come from a nurse at the Center for Infectious Diseases.\n\nThere are no vaccine requirements for Argentina, but my doctor still advises a vist to the infectious disease clinic. I'm an immigrant in a European country where my language skills are somewhere between lost tourist and toddler, which makes this sort of appointment nervewracking. At the front desk, the receptionist asks at full volume what infectious disease I was being treated for and then waves me upstairs to meet with a nurse.\n\nI explain to the nurse that I don't speak the local language. She disagrees, pointing out that I'd just said I don't speak the language in the language. Fine. I haltingly explain that I am going to  Argentina and sit back, my vocabulary expended.\n\nShe pulls up a browser with the website for the US Government Center for Disease Control and Prevention already loaded and scans the English-language page on Argentina before helpfully translating the key points for me into the language I just said that I didn't speak.\n\n\"Do you know typhoid?\" she asks.\n\n\"A little,\" I say, as if we'd met at a party once.\n\nShe rattles off instructions: don't drink the water, don't open my mouth while in the shower, disinfect my hands every time I wash them, don't eat \\[unintelligible\\]. I ask her repeat it. She says a word that I do not understand.\n\nShe pauses, rephrases and then, finally acknowledging my lack of fluency, switches to English. \"Don't eat salads.\"\n\nUm, ok. \"Steak?\" I ask, grinning.\n\n\"Yes. Eat steak.\" She is not smiling.\n\nShe shifts back to the local language to tell me we are definitely vaccinating me against yellow fever and hepatitis A. My consent is apparently not required.\n\nThen she gives me a long lecture about rabies in Argentina, but there are too many words I don't recognize.\n\nShe goes back to English with a sigh. If I get bitten by a dog or a monkey, I must go straight to the hospital.\n\nI nod to let her know that I am taking her advice seriously, while wondering how likely it is that I will be bitten by a monkey attending an Ethereum conference in Buenos Aires and also, how is it that the nurse knows the English word for “monkey” but not the word for “uncooked food”?\n\nThat's enough English, apparently. She quizzes me on my intentions. What am I doing there? Would I be with other people?\n\nBuenos Aires has a population of 16 million, so I am unlikely to be alone. But maybe this is a euphemistic phrase and she is working up to a talk on sexually transmitted diseases of Latin America. I admit yet again that I don't understand.\n\n“Are you travelling alone?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\nShe asks me another question where I understood only two words: pleasure and risk.\n\nI blink at her in obvious confusion and she takes pity on me.\n\n“Do you like risk?”\n\nI bite my lip. It seems like a bad idea to admit to being a risk junkie in the Centre for Infectious Diseases.\n\n“No?”\n\n“Good!” She thinks for a moment and comes to a decision. “I think we will also give you the rabies shot.”\n\nWith that, she pulls out a syringe. Apparently, the time for discussion is over.\n\n\\---\n\n**Part Two:** [**First Contact with Reality**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/1p95o9m/first_contact_with_reality_part_two_of_can_i_pay/) (KYC on a hostel bunk bed)\n\n(Edited to add links to Part Two)",

    "title": "You created a fresh ETH wallet for privacy? Cool. Now how are you funding it without linking it back to you?",
    "selftext": "Here's the thing about Ethereum that nobody wants to admit: imagine paying for coffee with crypto and the barista instantly seeing your entire net worth. That's absolutely untenable, right? But that's literally how it works today if you don't have the tools and know-how to operate onchain PRIVATELY. \n\nEvery transaction broadcasts your balance; every address you interact with is permastained as part of your public financial history; and most people try to \"fix\" this by creating a fresh wallet and funding it from Coinbase (not cypherpunk) or their main account (gg; no re)\n\nCongrats, you just created a permanent public link on Etherscan that anyone can follow.\n\nCreating a new wallet is easy. Funding it *privately* without linking it back to your identity? That's the hard part most tutorials skip.\n\nGood news is... there's a few tools and methods for protecting your safety and financial dignity! \n\nThis is the type of info that shouldn't be gatekept, so here's 3 ways you can fund a new wallet address privately:\n\n1. **Railgun (Zero-Knowledge)** – Shield funds into a private pool via Railway Wallet, then unshield to any fresh 0x address. Takes \\~1 hour for PPOI checks, but mathematically breaks the onchain link, and is compliant 👍. Uses actual zero-knowledge proofs, not marketing BS.\n2. **zkp2p (Bank → Crypto P2P)** – Uses zkTLS to prove Venmo/CashApp/Wise/etc payments without exposing personal data. Funds can be designated straight to a new wallet. Zero crypto footprint in your banking app because it just looks like you're sending $ to a friend!\n3. **OTC (Old School)** – Cash-for-crypto with trusted peers. High risk, requires strict safety protocols (public meetups, locked rates, verify token contracts), but it's what early OGs did pre-CEX.\n\nPrivacy shouldn't have to be explained. It's basic dignity. In this case, basic FINANCIAL dignity. Your net worth shouldnt be public info just because you want to use crypto.\n\nFor my latest youtube video, I go into exactly all of this! I hope ppl find it helpful :)\n\n[https://youtu.be/ppRz6Hqoics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppRz6Hqoics)\n\nAnd honestly... does it bother anyone else that we've normalized broadcasting our entire financial lives just to buy a coffee?",

If I upgrade my trusty old EOA address to enable smart contract functionalities using EIP-7702, does my address lose the ability to receive airdrops?

A family member of mine had $200k in an Ethereum liquidity pool (according to him), and it’s now being held as USDT in some wallet. He’s been in said pool for about 5 years AFAIK and claims he needs to pay $15k in gas fees to withdraw the USDT. I can front him the cash but this seems very odd to me that you cannot use the funds as a means of payment to make the said transaction. In short, I’m asking if my family member has been scammed and now I’m offering more money, or is this a legitimate liquidity pool, or is there a way for me to verify that it is. He sent me a screen shot of a “Ethereum-smart.com” if that’s familiar to anyone. Thanks in advance I hope I’ve made this clear enough. ",

    "title": "Do Kwon just got sentenced to 15 years for a $40 billion fraud while SBF got 25 years for an $11 billion fraud and the reason why is actually really intresting.",
    "selftext": "Kwons Terra-Luna collapse caused nearly four times more financial damage than FTX but he got 10 years less prison time. The judge called it fraud on an epic generational scale with hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide. So why the lighter sentence?\n\nThe biggest difference was how they handled their cases. Kwon pleaded guilty in August and took responsibility. He wrote to the court saying he was responsible for the pain people went through and that he led the community astray in his hubris. He listened to hundreds of victim impact statements and apologized directly.\n\nSBF on the other hand went to trial and maintained his innocence throughout. He claimed FTX just had a liquidity crisis not actual fraud. The jury convicted him in about four hours. Judge Kaplan found that SBF committed perjury multiple times on the stand and called his testimony some of the most evasive he’d seen in decades. SBF also tried to tamper with witnesses before trial by messaging FTXs former general counsel.\n\nAnother huge factor is Kwon faces up to 40 additional years in South Korea after he finishes his US sentence. The judge explicitly considered this when deciding on 15 years. SBF doesnt have any foreign charges waiting so his 25 years is basically it unless his appeal succeeds.\n\nThe takeaway here is pretty clear – cooperation and actual remorse can massively reduce your sentence even if your fraud was way bigger. Going to trial and lying under oath will get you hammered regardless of the dollar amounts involved.",

    "selftext": "The film is called One Attempt Remaining and stars Jennifer Garner. The plot is about a divorced couple who discover their cryptocurrency from a cruise they won together is now worth millions but they forgot the password. According to reports they have around a couple of days (roughly 48–72 hours) to recover $35 million before the claim expires and apparently theres basically only one attempt left to unlock it before they lose the funds for good.\n\nThis is basically every crypto holders nightmare turned into entertainment. The movie mirrors real life situations like Stefan Thomas who forgot the password to his IronKey hard drive containing 7,002 Bitcoin worth around $640 million today. He's already made 8 out of 10 allowed attempts and still hasnt gotten in. After 10 wrong tries the drive permanently erases everything.\n\nThen theres James Howells who threw away a hard drive with 8,000 Bitcoin back in 2013. Its sitting in a UK landfill somewhere and hes been fighting the city council for years to search for it but keeps losing legal battles.\n\nThe fact that Netflix is making this into a romantic comedy shows how mainstream crypto has become. These password nightmare stories used to be niche crypto community horror tales but now theyre Hollywood material.\n\nIts kinda funny but also dark when you think about how much wealth is permanently locked away because people forgot passwords or lost hardware. This movie will probably give everyone watching anxiety about their own crypto storage.\n\nWill definately watch this just to see how they handle the technical aspects and whether they make it accurate or go full Hollywood nonsense.\n\n  \n",

    "selftext": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has approved a pilot program allowing the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) to tokenize traditional financial securities, including stocks, bonds, exchange-traded funds and U.S. Treasuries, marking a major step toward integrating blockchain technology into the core plumbing of U.S. capital markets. The approval, issued via a no-action letter, permits DTCC’s Depository Trust Company to record and custody blockchain-based representations of securities known as tokenized entitlements while preserving their existing legal status under federal securities laws. The pilot is structured as a controlled, permissioned experiment, enabling regulated broker-dealers to transfer tokenized positions on approved blockchain networks without altering ownership rights or settlement obligations.\n\nFor DTCC, which processes trillions of dollars in transactions daily and underpins nearly all U.S. securities settlement, the move signals growing regulatory comfort with using blockchain to modernize legacy market infrastructure. Proponents argue tokenization could eventually enable faster settlement, reduced counterparty risk, improved transparency, and lower operational costs, while regulators emphasize that the initiative is incremental and tightly supervised.",

It’s hard not to be bullish when big companies are making strategic moves like this, and it makes me wonder what other acquisitions have been happening under the radar.\n\nOne move that stood out to me was Nехо’s acquisition of Buеnbit, which strengthens their presence in LATAM. We saw Cоinbase acquire Dеribit and Ripplе acquire Hidden Rоad, all of which contribute to the sense that major players are positioning themselves for a larger global footprint.\n\nI wanna know if anyone here has noticed smaller or emerging deals that aren’t making headlines. It genuinely feels like we’re at the start of another big M&A cycle, and I’m trying to track what else is shifting in the background.\n\n",

    "selftext": "I’m curious how others think about allocation here. I'm not talking about your trading stack or long term btc/eth holds, specifically the stable portion thats meant to be dry powder or just earning while you wait.\n\nI’m currently sitting at about 27% stables which feels high but also rates are decent right now so not mad about it. The question is whether to keep it all liquid earning yield or deploy more into positions.\n\nmy setup right now is roughly:\n\n- 45% btc eth sol long term holds\n- 27% stables earning yield\n- 18% altcoin positions\n- 10% actual cash in bank for bills and stuff\n\nThe stable portion is split between a couple yield sources, trying not to have everything in one place. I’m getting somewhere around 7% average across them which feels good for money thats basically just waiting.\n\nBut I’m also seeing people talk about being more aggressive in current market conditions so I’m wondering if my stable allocation is too conservative or if having that cushion is actually smart. Every time I get the urge to deploy more I remember how nice it was having dry powder during the last dip.\n\nhow do you guys think about this? is there a percentage that feels right or does it depend entirely on market conditions",

    "selftext": "\n\nA lot of people say airdrops are dead but honestly, I don’t agree.\n\nAirdrops don’t die, they just evolve.\n\nProjects will always need users and early traction. That’s why we’ve seen cycles like Aptos → Sui → Grass → mini Telegram apps → InfoFi → and more. The mechanism changes, but the incentive model stays.\n\nI still farm airdrops because:\n\n\\- They still give real money (even if not Aptos-level $3k/account anymore)\n\n\\- It’s basically free upside if you’re early\n\n\\- Low effort, decent reward\n\n\\- Slow/bearish periods create the best opportunities when others stop paying attention\n\nI’m currently farming Mention, an AI visibility project.\n\nTheir Web2 competitor Profound raised $60M. Mention is building similar tech but for both Web2 + Web3:\n\n\\- They sell the product to Web2\n\n\\- Web3 contributors get incentives\n\n\\- Still early stage, which is why I think it’s worth trying\n\nIf you want to check it out (and support me with a ref): [https://mention.network/earn/?invite=uVqwKD](https://mention.network/earn/?invite=uVqwKD)\n\nGuide here: [https://mention.network/learn/how-to-earn-mention-points-complete-prompt-to-earn-instruction-2025/](https://mention.network/learn/how-to-earn-mention-points-complete-prompt-to-earn-instruction-2025/)",

So why is Elon Musk now breaking up 8,285 BTC worth roughly $770 million?\n\nThe company ranks fourth among the largest private holders of Bitcoin. Musk's influence on the crypto market is enormous. Could he be predicting a crash after January 15th, the date when MicroStrategy shares are set to be removed from the MSCI index?\n\nBitcoin split across multiple wallets is much easier to sell over-the-counter. You could just hand the buyer a seed phrase. This way, Musk and SpaceX could keep the deal quiet and avoid tanking the market.\n\nThat said, some press reports suggest the Bitcoin is being moved as part of preparations for a record-breaking IPO in 2026.",

Long-term holders are distributing more than usual, but macro conditions and liquidity cycles could still shift the picture quickly if demand reappears.\n\nSo the big question is: **are we looking at a temporary mid-cycle correction or the early stages of a real bear phase?**\n\nCurious to hear how others are positioning.

Over all, I did quite well apart from being down 25k on a 35k account in one trade lol. It got back however, and in the end of October I had a profit of 21k over the year which was absolutely amazing to me. Guess what, when the sell of started, I went more or less all-in with a little leverage (50 ETH to be precise), thinking it will bounce up again quickly as it did within the last weeks. It didn't, so at the end I've been down 53k (!) and almost got liquidated. My liquidation level was 2598 USD and it went down to 2621. I felt like shit and was sure I'm gonna lose it all. For some reason, the market turned and with today's profits I managed to get out break-even regarding my initial account balance. So I lost a little over 21k with just one trade and now I'm up 46 USD for the whole year. I know I got REALLY lucky not losing it all, it was incredibly close. I see it as a second chance not many people get, so pray for me that I'm gonna be more responsible the next time.",

The price even pushed past $3,350 and touched a high of $3,396 before consolidating. Right now its trading above $3,200 and showing strong momentum with a bullish trendline forming around the $3,210 support level.\n\nThe technical setup looks pretty solid. If ETH can break above the $3,380 resistance it could target $3,420 next and possibly even $3,500 to $3,550 in the near term. The momentum indicators are flipping bullish with the MACD gaining strength and RSI above 50 which usually signals more upside potential.\n\nWhats intresting is Ethereum is outperforming btc right now. While BTC struggles around $92k, ETH is showing relative strength which could mean we're seeing a rotation into alts or specifically into Ethereum based on fundamentals or technical breakouts.\n\nHowever theres still risk here. If ETH fails to clear the $3,380 level it could pull back to support at $3,250 or even $3,210. A break below $3,210 would be concerning and might send it back toward $3,150 or lower.\n\nThe consolidation after the initial pump is actually healthy. It shows buyers are absorbing supply at these levels rather than just a quick pump and dump. The question is whether buyers have enough strength to push through the next resistance zone.\n\nETH dominance has also been ticking up on the charts lately, which kind of supports the idea of a short term momentum shift away from Bitcoin, at least for now.",

You have market data, on-chain stuff, social metrics, tokenomics and so on.\n\nRight now I’m looking at things like:\n\n* price movements + chart patterns\n* holder concentration / distribution\n* on-chain activity (tx count, active addresses, fees)\n* liquidity and volume across exchanges\n* dev activity / ecosystem growth\n* open interest\n* supply + unlock schedule\n\n**Which metrics do you find interesting to look at when comparing or analyzing coins?**\n\nAre there any indicators you think are underrated or overrated?\n\nSide note: I’m currently working on a free crypto comparison tool and want to bake some of these metrics into the UI.\n\nCurious to hear what you think!",

This landmark statement, delivered at the annual Blockchain Association summit, could be pivotal in reviving ICOs in the US.\n\nAccording to Atkins' proposed classification, only 'tokenised securities' — digital representations of regulated assets — will remain under the SEC's jurisdiction. Categories such as network tokens, digital instruments and collectible digital items are not securities in and of themselves.\n\nConsequently, ICOs related to these three categories should be excluded from SEC oversight and transferred to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which takes a more lenient regulatory approach.\n\nThis position is an important step for the crypto industry as it significantly reduces regulatory barriers. It will enable companies to raise capital by issuing new tokens with minimal risk of lawsuits, something which previously paralysed the ICO market after the 2017 boom. Regardless of legislation on the structure of the crypto market being adopted, these comments pave the way for the ICO mechanism to restart rapidly.",

    "selftext": "Bitcoin’s energy use has been one of its biggest criticisms for years, but Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just offered a very different perspective. Speaking during a panel on AI and energy, Huang said Bitcoin actually converts excess electricity into a portable form of money essentially reframing mining as a way to monetize unused power rather than waste it. Coming from the guy whose chips run most of today’s AI infrastructure, it’s a notable shift in tone. Supporters of Bitcoin have been arguing for a while that more mining is happening on stranded or renewable energy, and Huang’s comments line up with that narrative. It doesn’t magically solve all the environmental concerns, but it’s interesting to hear a major tech leader describe Bitcoin as part of the energy economy instead of a problem for it. Curious how others here see this is this a fair way to look at mining, or just a convenient reframing?",

    "title": "Market behavior shifted: pumps last hours not days, dumps recover faster",
    "selftext": "Trading since 2020. Market tempo changed significantly in 2025 vs previous cycles.\n\nWhat I'm noticing: Pump duration: 2021 pumps lasted 3-7 days with sustained momentum. Now? 6-18 hours then immediate correction. Blink and you miss the move. AND Dump recovery: 2021 dumps took 2-3 weeks to recover baseline. Now? 2-4 days back to pre-dump levels. Volatility compresses much faster.\n\nVolume patterns: Used to build gradually over days. Now spikes in single sessions then dies immediately.\n\nWhy this matters for execution? If you're still using 2021 timeframes for entry/exit decisions, you're consistently late to both moves.\n\nExample: Token pumps 40% over 8 hours during US session.\n\n* Old approach: \"I'll wait for pullback tomorrow to enter\"\n* Reality: Already corrected 30% by next morning, momentum completely gone\n\nBy the time you \"confirm the trend,\" it's over.\n\nWhat fundamentally changed:\n\nAlgorithmic trading dominance - Bots react in milliseconds, push prices fast, take profit fast Improved liquidity - Deeper order books = quicker mean reversion to fair value  \nRetail FOMO compression - Everyone sees pumps simultaneously (Twitter/Telegram), window closes faster Derivatives impact - Perpetual funding rates force quick unwinding, accelerating reversals\n\nMy strategy adaptation - stopped waiting for \"confirmation\" - By the time move is \"confirmed,\" it's 50% done\n\nPre-set limit orders - During pumps, set buy limits at -15-20% below current price. Either catches the inevitable pullback or I miss it entirely. No chasing.\n\nAutomated exits - Set profit targets before entering. When something pumps, auto-sells execute at predetermined levels. Can't hesitate when move only lasts 6 hours.\n\nThe uncomfortable reality:\n\nManual trading feels increasingly inadequate. Human reaction time (even experienced traders) = 5-30 seconds to decide and execute. By then, algorithmic traders already moved price 2-3%.\n\nYou're either automating key decisions or accepting you're slower than the market.\n\nAre you seeing this tempo acceleration or am I overthinking? What timeframes are you using for entries/exits in 2025 vs 2021? I shifted from daily/4hr charts to 1hr/15min for actual execution timing. And how are you adapting to faster market cycles? More automation? Shorter holding periods? Different altogether?",

    "selftext": "Speaking in Abu Dhabi, Saylor laid out a vision where countries could use Bitcoin reserves and tokenized credit to offer regulated bank accounts that give way higher returns than traditional deposits. He pointed out that banks in Japan, Europe and Switzerland barely pay any interest while US money market funds are around 4%. People are basically disgusted with their bank accounts which is why corporate bonds exist.\n\nHis proposal involves structuring accounts with about 80% digital credit instruments, 20% regular currency, and an extra 10% buffer to reduce volatility. The digital credit layer would be backed by Bitcoin reserves with about 5 to 1 overcollateralization. Basically using Bitcoin as the ultimate collateral layer.\n\nSaylor thinks a country that implements this could attract $20 to $50 trillion in deposits and become the digital banking capital of the world. Thats not a small claim.\n\nHowever theres obvious skepticism here. Bitcoin is down 28% from its recent highs and dropped 9% over the past year. The volatility makes people question how you can build stable high yield products on top of it. One former bond trader called Saylors moves folly and said hiking rates to maintain a peg wont work when people want their money back during a panic.\n\nStrategy already has a product called STRC that works somewhat like this - its grown to $2.9 billion but faces doubts about whether it can handle a real liquidity crunch.\n\nThe idea is innovative but feels like it requires Bitcoin to keep appreciating long term to actually work.

    "selftext": "Back in October 2024 when BTC was in the 63–70k range, I needed liquidity but didn’t really want to sell. Instead I took a crypto-backed loan through one of the larger CeFi lenders (think nехо) where I already kept part of my BTC. I later found out they’re actually one of the biggest players in the space, right after Tether in terms of lending volume, which made me realise how mainstream this model has become.\n\nI used BTC as collateral, got the funds I needed, and just left the coins sitting there. Fast forward to BTC above 110k - loan was repaid and I’m pretty relieved I didn’t try to time the market. For me this was never about leverage. It was simply about not being forced to sell an asset I still believe in long-term.\n\nThere’s also a psychological benefit. When your BTC isn’t sitting in your spot wallet as a big shiny “sell” button, you’re less tempted to panic on every dip. You get liquidity without second-guessing yourself during volatility.\n\nAnyone else using loans instead of selling?",

    "selftext": "Lately, crypto feels less like “early access tech” and more like something you can use on a day-to-day basis. A few years ago, everything seemed built for traders and degens experiments. Now swaps are smoother, onboarding is easy, yield is easily accessible, and you can spend crypto or stables with a card directly.\n\nI still use DeFi for part of my bags because I enjoy experimenting and having control. If I want something simple and predictable, I lean on a more regulated, CeFi-style platform (in my case Nехо), keep some liquidity there, earn yield on stables, and spend via a card when I need to. It’s less about the maximum APY and more about low-friction convenience.\n\nThat shift feels more meaningful than any price move. Have you changed how you use crypto in daily life compared to the last cycle, or is it still mostly trading and holding for you?",

    "selftext": "NEXT WEEK COULD BE ONE OF THE MOST EXPLOSIVE WEEKS IN CRYPTO HISTORY\n\nMarket sentiment is accelerating, liquidity models are shifting upward, and multiple macroeconomic triggers are converging at the same time. When this level of alignment occurs, markets often enter major expansion phases. Here is what is coming — and why it is critical for the next crypto cycle:\n\n\n---\n\nMONDAY — POTENTIAL QE SIGNALS\nEarly economic indicators point toward the possibility of renewed Quantitative Easing. If confirmed, this would inject large-scale liquidity into the financial system. Crypto historically responds faster and stronger than traditional markets when liquidity increases, making this a major early-week catalyst.\n\n\n---\n\nTUESDAY — POWELL’S SPEECH\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will deliver guidance that may set the tone for global markets. Any suggestion of stabilizing inflation, easing financial pressures, or improving economic momentum can immediately shift investor appetite toward high-growth assets, including crypto. His tone alone has moved markets in previous cycles.\n\n\n---\n\nWEDNESDAY — FOMC RATE CUT DECISION\nThis is the defining event of the week. A rate cut signals cheaper borrowing, increased circulation of capital, and renewed risk-taking across financial markets. Historically, crypto has posted some of its strongest rallies following a confirmed rate cut.\n\n\n---\n\nTHURSDAY — EXPECTED LIQUIDITY EXPANSION OF $10–15 BILLION\nIf liquidity injections meet projections, the market will receive substantial fresh capital. Crypto responds aggressively to sudden liquidity inflows, often front-running traditional markets by weeks.\n\n\n---\n\nFRIDAY — ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEW FED PRESIDENT\nA leadership change may introduce a more flexible, market-friendly policy environment. This could reinforce long-term bullish sentiment and support the start of a new cycle.\n\n\n---\n\nIMPLICATIONS FOR CRYPTO\nThe alignment of rate cuts, liquidity expansion, softening policy, and macro stability is rare. Historically, similar weeks have marked the beginning of powerful bull markets. Market structure, tightening charts, and rising liquidity all indicate that the next expansion phase may begin imminently.",

    "selftext": "Their research team is pointing to improving liquidity and markets pricing in about a 92% chance of a Fed rate cut at the December 9–10 meeting. As of December 4th the odds of a rate cut jumped to 92%, which has often been supportive for risk assets like crypto in past cycles. They're also tracking global money supply which has been expanding lately.\n\nBack in October Coinbase actually predicted weakness in November followed by a December reversal and so far that's playing out. Bitcoin is hovering around $90k after dropping from highs near $100k last month.\n\nHowever the big wildcard is Fed Chair Jerome Powell's comments during the rate decision press conference. Analysts say if Powell sounds hawkish about 2026 policy it could put a cap on any rally even if they cut rates. His previous hawkish remarks in November contributed to the selloff we just saw.\n\nMarket sentiment is still pretty fearful right now. Both institutional and retail investors are hesitant to jump back in which is keeping markets in limbo. The technical picture shows Bitcoin already retested the $80k area and bounced off support tho.\n\nOne positive catalyst is speculation that Kevin Hassett might become the next Fed Chair in 2026. He's seen as way more dovish which would be bullish for crypto long term.\n\nSo basically the setup looks decent for a December recovery but everyones gonna be watching what Powell says super closely. One wrong comment could derail things fast.",

Dec 9 – JOLTs Job Openings (Forecast: 7.2M)\n\n   \nBelow expectations → signals softening labor conditions and more room for future policy easing.\n\n   \nAbove expectations → indicates labor resilience and could reduce the probability of cuts.  \n2. Dec 10 – FOMC Decision + Powell’s Press Conference  \nA 25bps cut is widely expected, so Powell’s tone may play a larger role in shaping market reaction.  \nAnalysts are watching for any comments related to liquidity management tools aimed at stabilizing smaller financial institutions.\n\n   \nDovish tone → supportive for broader risk sentiment\n\n   \nHawkish tone → potential for increased volatility  \n3. Dec 11 – PPI Inflation Data\n\n  \nCooler PPI → reinforces the disinflation trend\n\n  \nHotter PPI → may trigger short-term risk-off positioning  \nWhy It Matters  \nCrypto markets tend to react to direction in yields, dollar strength, and liquidity expectations. Lower yields and clearer easing signals historically align with stronger risk appetite.\n\n   \n4. Also Noteworthy in the Crypto Ecosystem  \nAlongside the macro events, the week includes a notable industry update:\n\n   \nStable mainnet is scheduled to go live, with a related launchpool appearing on Bitget.  \nThis is primarily a sector-specific development and may draw attention within the infrastructure and staking segments of the crypto market.",

I keep seeing news about a new “Fusaka” upgrade but I do not really understand what it does or why people say it is important. \n\nFor those who understand this much better than me, could you please explain in simple everyday language:.\n\nWhat actually changed on Ethereum with Fusaka for normal users and for Layer‑2s (is anything cheaper or faster now)?\n\nWhat do you think are the main advantages and disadvantages of this upgrade? For example, good things like lower fees or better security, and possible risks or trade‑offs. \n\nHow does Fusaka fit into Ethereum’s long‑term roadmap – is this a small step or a really big one, and what opportunities do you personally see coming from it?",

Ultimately it's just a way to distract real investors out of BTC by inciting people to make bigger gains, and gradually making it a world currency.\n\nUltimately, the alts end up feeding BTCs growth.\n\n",

    "selftext": "The fine is hitting X for three main violations. First up is the blue checkmark system. The EU ruled that turning verification into a paid subscription is deceptive design because it misleads people about who's actually authenticated. Before you could trust a blue check meant someone was who they claimed to be. Now anyone can buy one which defeats the whole purpose.\n\nSecond issue is ad transparency. X failed to create a clear public database showing who paid for ads and why users are seeing specific political or commercial content. The new EU rules require platforms to be transparent about advertising so people understand when they're being targeted and by who.\n\nThird problem is data access for researchers. X put up barriers that prevented academics and researchers from studying public posts on the platform. This matters for understanding misinformation spreads, political manipulation, and other issues that affect society.\n\nX now has 60 days to fix the blue check mess and 90 days to address the ad transparency and data access problems. If they dont comply the fines could get way bigger.\n\nThis is relevant to crypto markets because X is where alot of crypto discussion and promotion happens. If ad transparency rules tighten up it could change how projects market themselves and how influencers disclose paid promotions.\n\nAlso this sets a precedent for how regulators might approach other platforms that crypto communities use heavily.\n\nWhat do you think about platforms charging for verification?",

It's been proven in history that money centralizes during uncertainty. We have the working-class population, who are the vast majority of investments for alternate cryptocurrency... worrying about AI and the job market. So far 1.1 million jobs have been completely eliminated from the U.S. this year due to automation. Excluding 2020, when COVID anomaly took place,  the usual amount of layoffs per year since 2010 have been anywhere between 500,000 to 750,000 max. Layoffs spiked in 2001 coinciding with the dotcom crash. and spiked again during the 2008 and 2009 (1.2million layoffs each).\n\nAnd we aren't the only economy who's hurting right now.\n\nThe economy is strained and when people have nothing to worry about, alts will come back.\n\nThe majority of all the volume in the onesies and twosies alt coin pops now are from Korean Exchanges.",

Each retest of that line has caused a selloff.\n\nCurrent Position:\n\nPrice is inside the triangle and slightly pulling back after touching the resistance line near $92,000.\n\nIf price breaks above that level with high volume, momentum flips bullish.\n\n\n---\n\n📌 1H Chart Overview\n\nThe 1H chart shows a smaller ascending channel forming from the November 19th low. This creates bullish pressure from below while the macro downtrend caps the upside.\n\nThis squeeze normally leads to a strong breakout.\n\n\n---\n\n🟩 SAFE ENTRY LEVELS\n\n✅ Entry 1 – Aggressive Buy (Support Bounce)\n\nBuy Zone: $87,000 – $85,500\nWhen BTC taps the ascending support line.\n\nWhy:\n\nMultiple responses at this level\n\nVolume spikes on past bounces\n\nLower risk, tighter SL\n\n\nStop-Loss: $84,300\n\n\n---\n\n✅ Entry 2 – Breakout Buy (Confirmation)\n\nBuy Above: $92,800 – $93,200\nWait for a breakout + retest of the descending trendline.\n\nWhy:\n\nBreak of the macro trendline\n\nConfirmed shift to bullish trend\n\nGood for safer traders\n\n\nStop-Loss: $90,500\n\n\n---\n\n🔻 SAFE SELL (SHORT) ENTRY\n\n❌ Short Entry – Trendline Rejection\n\nIf BTC touches $92,000 – $93,000 and gets rejected:\n\nEntry to Short: $91,800 – $92,500\nStop-Loss: $93,800\nTake-Profit:\n\n1. $89,500\n\n\n2. $87,500\n\n\n3. $85,800\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n🎯 TAKE PROFIT TARGETS (FOR LONGS)\n\nTP for Bounce Entry:\n\n1. TP1: $89,500\n\n\n2. TP2: $92,000\n\n\n3. TP3: $94,800 (if a breakout occurs)\n\n\n\nTP for Breakout Entry:\n\n1. TP1: $95,500\n\n\n2. TP2: $98,800\n\n\n3. TP3: $102,000+ (if volume is strong)\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n⚠️ RISK WARNING\n\nThis setup is valid as long as BTC stays above $85,000.\nIf it breaks below that → expect $82,000 – $80,000 area next.\n\n",

You will match with random users based upon your interest. You can choose to chat with them or skip to the next user. You can save them to your friendlist to connect again later if you vibe with them. There are group chatrooms too if you aren't comfortable with one to one chat.\n\nVooz is into Web3 too, and it's the first anonymous video chat platform to have a web3 presence. It has its own token $Vooz which can be used to access premium features on the website like gender and location filter etc. Also, hangouts will be up on the platform soon. Hangouts are basically fun group chatrooms where users can stream movies, watch youtube, share screen, video chat or audio chat together. Anyone can create a hangout and participants will be able to gift stuff to the hangout mod. Omegle didn't have hangouts, neither does any other anonymous chat platform. Stay bullish fam!

    "title": "Is Talus Network Building an Economy of Agents or Testing a Bigger Idea",
    "selftext": "I keep asking myself what Talus Network is really trying to unlock. Is it simply another Layer 1 with a fresh narrative, or is it laying foundations for a future where autonomous agents become active participants in on chain economies? Talus is designed specifically for decentralized AI agents and multi agent systems, combining Sui Move for smart contracts with Cosmos SDK for consensus. That architectural choice alone raises questions about intent and long term vision.\n\nAt the core of the network is Nexus, a framework that enables autonomous agents to execute complex workflows such as prediction markets, asset management and personalized automation. Every decision is auditable, every interaction verifiable. This notion of mathematical trust feels like a direct challenge to opaque AI systems. When thinking about how this could be introduced to the market, I cannot help but speculate on incentive design. With the listing approaching, a possible launchpool could align well with Talus core philosophy, especially if it emphasizes participation over passive yield. If Bitget chooses to support such a launchpool after listing the token tomorrow, it could set an interesting precedent for how agent focused networks reach early users.\n\nThe testnet activity adds more context. Over thirty five thousand users explored the ecosystem, completing more than seventy two thousand tasks and generating fifty four thousand AI responses. Idolfun introduced a curious experiment where AI driven virtual influencers competed while users voted on their output, all executed on chain. I keep wondering whether this was just an engaging application or an early signal of how attention, prediction and incentive structures could merge in an agent driven economy.\n\nThe reward design also stands out. One hundred and twenty five thousand dollars distributed through contests, task centers, loyalty hubs and social engagement. Participants used Sui wallets, completed quests and earned points that now sit as potential claims for future airdrops. It makes me question how much early participation and behavioral data might matter once the mainnet fully opens.\n\nToken design adds another angle worth examining. A fixed supply of ten billion $US tokens with no inflation suggests deliberate scarcity. Around twenty two percent circulating at TGE, while contributors and investors remain locked behind long cliffs and vesting schedules, points to an attempt at controlling short term sell pressure. Community and ecosystem allocations take a significant share, which signals long term growth intentions, but will that translate into sustained usage?\n\nI have my own views, but I am more curious about others. Do you see Talus as foundational infrastructure for decentralized AI, or as an ambitious experiment still finding its footing? How do you think early incentive structures will shape the behavior of both users and agents as this network evolves?  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/talus-network](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/talus-network)",

    "selftext": "Talus Network is a Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for decentralized AI applications. Running on a MoveVM fork derived from the Sui ecosystem, it introduces the Nexus framework  a system designed to let autonomous AI agents execute verifiable actions directly on-chain. This means smart contracts can be triggered or influenced by offchain AI models while maintaining cryptographic proof of inference and execution. The project has raised north of $10 million from investors including Polychain Capital, dao5, Sui Foundation, Animoca Brands and Spartan Group and its mainnet launch is expected in the coming weeks following the recent testnet phases.\n\nWhat sets Talus apart from general purpose L1s is its focus on agent centric architecture: developers can deploy AI models that own wallets, manage positions in DeFi protocols, run prediction markets, or control NPCs in onchain games without centralized intermediaries. The network uses a combination of zero knowledge proofs and TEE based attestation (via partnerships like Arcium and Inco) to make AI inference results verifiable and tamper resistant. With the broader narrative around crypto × AI heating up again, Talus is positioning itself as infrastructure for the next wave of autonomous onchain entities worth keeping an eye on for anyone interested in the intersection of Move based ecosystems and agent driven applications. In related news, the project's native token $US is scheduled to list on Bitget today December 11, 2025, at 13:00 with deposits already open for trading preparation.\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/talus-network/\n\r\n\r",

    "title": "Dogecoin ETFs Are Cooling Off, But DOGE Itself Isn’t",
    "selftext": "Dogecoin’s spot ETFs in the U.S. look like they are losing momentum fast. Total value traded (TVT) dropped to just $142K, the lowest since launch, a big contrast to late November when volumes briefly hit $3.23M. TVT matters because it shows how much actual liquidity is flowing through the ETF wrapper, and right now the pipes are running pretty dry.\n\nWhat’s interesting is that this slowdown isnt coming from lack of interest in DOGE itself. In the same 24-hour window, the underlying asset did over $1.1B in spot trading volume with a market cap around $22.6B. Traders clearly still care about DOGE, they are just choosing to access it directly on exchanges instead of through traditional ETF products.\n\nThis kind of disconnect highlights a broader trend we’re seeing across the market, retail traders still prefer fast-moving, exchange based environments for altcoins. You can even see it in the way some platforms are structuring their short term volume events, for example, the Crazy 48h on Bitget recently drew attention simply because people wanted to compare activity across assets and see where liquidity was actually flowing. It doesnt change the ETF story, but it does show how trader behavior is shifting toward high liquidity, high speed environments rather than slow ETF wrappers.\n\nOverall, the Dogecoin ETF numbers suggest early hype didn’t translate into sustained use. DOGE still has liquidity, just not in the traditional finance format analysts expected. As always, DYOR before drawing big conclusions.\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/)",

Instead of buying the token on day one and riding the volatility, I’m testing it through airdrops first and watching how the market prices it.\n\nContext: I’ve been holding a small amount of $BGB since last year, so I’m not adding fresh capital for this. I’m just using what I already have to see if these short launch windows are still worth paying attention to going into 2026.\n\nWhat made StableChain / $STABLE interesting to me is the positioning. It’s not trying to be a general “do everything” L1. The focus is stablecoin payments and settlement, with USDT used as the gas token, which sounds practical if the goal is predictable fees and smoother UX.\n\nI’m not assuming any airdrop or guaranteed upside here. I just want to see whether a stablecoin-focused chain can carve out a real niche, or if it’s mostly narrative until adoption shows up.\n\nHow are you guys playing this one?  \nAre you trading first and letting price discovery settle, trading the first few days, or skipping listings entirely?  \nAnd for stablecoin infrastructure projects, what’s the one thing you watch that actually signals adoption?\n\nNot financial advice, genuinely curious how others approach these.  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stable/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stable/)",

    "title": "Bitget Eyes Upcoming USDT-Powered StableChain Listing and Stablechain Testnet Progress",
    "selftext": "I’ve been looking into StableChain and, from my perspective, it feels different from the usual Layer-1 narratives we see cycle after cycle. A chain built specifically for stablecoins, using USDT itself as gas, sounds practical on paper. But the real question I keep coming back to is whether this kind of “stablechain” model is what the market actually needs right now, or if it’s simply well timed.\n\nStableChain’s testnet has been live since early November, and it already feels like the groundwork phase is well underway. Gas-free peer-to-peer transfers, fast finality, and EVM compatibility all sound familiar, yet the focus on stablecoin settlement rather than speculation is what stands out to me. Are users interacting because the infrastructure makes sense, or because people are positioning early for what might come next?\n\nThe lack of an officially announced governance token makes things more interesting. Community campaigns, testnet activity, and point-style participation often end up meaning something later, but not always. I find myself asking whether these early actions are simply engagement tools, or quiet filters for future eligibility if a governance token eventually launches.\n\nWith a listing date around the corner and **b**itget likely part of the broader exposure plan, it raises another question. Does exchange visibility at this stage help StableChain attract real users, or does it mostly pull in short-term participants looking for the next incentive?\n\nAnd then there’s launchpool speculation. If a governance token does emerge, could a launchpool or similar staking model be the bridge between testnet activity and wider distribution? It wouldn’t be the first time early infrastructure projects took that route, especially when exchanges want alignment between users, liquidity, and long-term participation.\n\nI don’t have a firm conclusion yet. For now, I’m watching who is actually interacting with the StableChain testnet and how exchanges like Bitget position it ahead of the stable listing.  \n  \nIf you’re following StableChain closely, are you using the testnet as a builder, a user, or simply as a possible setup for what comes next?  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stable](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stable)",

In this case it has been a full year of auditing.\n\nRecently they announced their enterprise product being implemented with Ueno bank, which didn't get much attention. \n\nThere is major opportunity with Quantum readiness outside crypto.  It is a worldwide market need and it is Massive. \n\nWhen it comes to the quantum narrative, the common talking point is either top coins will easily upgrade with no problems, or that we hardly should worry because we'll have \"bigger\" problems elsewhere.    \n  \nLet's assume that's true.\n\nThen it makes a couple things crystal clear.  All systems have to get this upgrade work done.  And most systems are going to leverage solutions rather than start from scratch. \n\nNow the quantum risk narrative is gaining strength.  It's everywhere. As more coins keep talking about their upgrade plans, it shines a light on projects that saw the opportunities years ago. \n  \nThe work Qanplatform has done to offer solutions outside of crypto creates utility for a completely new untapped market.  They are powering Signquantum which is what Ueno bank is implementing.  That's a gigantic first step into the space.  It sets them up for both growth and high visibility. They've also built a use case with IBM. And they're building their network through Linux PQCA and Blockchain4Europe. \n\nWith all this, look for a combination of mainnet buzz, marketing, and more enterprise partner news. \n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/qanplatform/ \n",

    "selftext": "I’ve been following $PI lately, and the unlock schedule has me thinking. December is going to be huge, with nearly 190 million tokens hitting the market and a record day of about 7.2 million on December 6. With liquidity being so thin right now, it makes me wonder how wild the swings could get. Are traders already bracing for it, or will most people get caught off guard when the numbers start moving?\n\nThen there’s the way the unlocks taper from January onward, around 121 million a month, dropping to about 76 million by June. On one hand, that should ease some of the inflation pressure, but it also makes me ask whether the market will actually start to calm down or if the shadow of December’s big release will hang over prices for months. Are people planning ahead for this, or are they just reacting as it happens?\n\nI also can’t stop thinking about what happens during periods of thin liquidity. Who really benefits from these big moves? Will early movers take advantage while smaller holders feel the squeeze? And as the monthly unlocks get smaller, does that give the market a chance to grow more naturally, or will we still see sudden, chaotic swings when someone decides to move a lot at once? Maybe stepping back from $PI for a bit and focusing on on-chain trades on bitget is a way to watch the market evolve and see what the mystery box has in store while waiting to watch how the price reacts. Watching $PI’s unlock schedule has me thinking more carefully about timing, liquidity, and how traders respond. It feels like a moment to pay attention, observe, and maybe even rethink how I approach these kinds of events.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pi](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pi)",

    "selftext": "Lately I’ve been testing out some of these short Web3 events just to explore new altcoins and see which projects actually have something interesting behind them. That is how I came across the Crazy 48H event that included DMC.\n\nI saw someone mention that they reached the top 10 with about $5000 in trading volume, so I figured I would give it a try as well. I traded around $3000 so far and I am still nowhere near the top 10, but the process has been interesting. I even used a tool to check basic trend signals on DMC before entering, mostly to avoid making emotional or rushed decisions during these quick events.\n\nDMC itself is a strange one. It mixes tokenized vehicle build slots with digital asset ideas tied to the DeLorean brand. I have joined a couple of these quick events before with AIA and UXLINK and made about $200, but DMC definitely feels more experimental than the usual altcoins I bump into.\n\nSo I wanted to ask the community here how you view these hybrid altcoins.  \nDo projects like DMC have room to grow in the market, or do they usually stay niche no matter how creative the idea is?   \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/demcp/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/demcp/)",

    "selftext": "After recent market dips, eyes are on $TAO (Bittensor) prepping for its FIRST halving event. Supply slash incoming, just like BTC's playbook. Could spark a massive AI-driven pump! Meanwhile, Solana gets a boost with Kalshi's tokenized event contracts landing on the chain. $SOL holders, rejoice! What's your top pick this month?\n\nSo Bitcoin has been on a bit of a rollercoaster again. After tanking recently, it actually bounced back to around $93k today, which a lot of people are crediting to some surprisingly positive regulatory and macro news.\n\nEver since BTC hit $126k on Oct 6th, it has basically been drifting downwards with no clear direction. So personally, I am playing it safe. I have been sticking to on-chain tokens on Bitget because the rewards are consistent and it doesn’t stress over every BTC swing. It has been a good balance for me also the new comers, safer but still generating returns.\n\nAdd in rising expectations of a Fed rate cut next week, and it makes sense why BTC suddenly has some upward pressure again. But volatility lately has been wild, and I am not convinced this rebound is going to be smooth or stable.\n\n\nhttps://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana\n\n",

A friend kept telling me to stop stressing over charts and just try some smaller, low-risk on-chain activities  like trading $USELESS instead.\n\nI eventually gave in and checked out this “mystery box” thing he mentioned on Bitget’s on-chain section. I wasn’t expecting much, but it turned out to be a surprisingly decent way to stay active without throwing big money into the market. Put in a tiny amount just to test it, got some rewards back, and it actually helped me rebuild a bit of confidence.\n\nNot saying it’s life-changing or anything, but I’m mostly wondering how I didn’t hear about these kinds of events earlier would’ve saved me a lot of stress during the rough months.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theuselesscoin](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/theuselesscoin)",

Every time I check my PnL, it feels like someone turned the lights off. % $ESPORTS fell 8.63% in the past 24 hours while the broader market managed a 7.31% climb, and it’s impossible not to feel the sting. Traders clearly took profits after the 1 December Bitrue listing, and the weakness in altcoins combined with extreme fear sentiment just made everything worse. Watching a critical support at $0.4286 break and selling accelerate is frustrating in a way that almost hurts me.\n\nIt’s not just the numbers, it’s the feeling of being stuck in a loop of red candles. I make a move thinking the trend might shift, but the charts don’t care about my plans. Every support level seems like a mirage, every small rebound disappears before I can even breathe. The technicals are brutal, and it’s like % $ESPORTS refuses to cooperate no matter how much I watch and analyze. I keep questioning myself, my entries, and my patience, and the frustration keeps building.\n\nAt this point, I’m having to shift my focus to other onchain tokens on bitget, hoping for a chance to grab that mystery box and maybe catch the next green candles.

Raw milk, farmers’ markets, cold plunges…. the whole “real life” movement is taking over.\n\nRAWW didn’t jump on the trend. **RAWW is the trend, memefied.**\n\nWhere most memecoins push gambling, degeneracy, and nothingness, RAWW is the opposite:  \n**The first anti-degen meme project with an actual message**\n\n**Read the whitepaper:** [**https://rawwmilkcoin.com/milkpaper/**](https://rawwmilkcoin.com/milkpaper/)\n\nThe narrative hits  \nNatural lifestyle + anti-degen humor = viral \n\nhttps://i.redd.it/on8lrjzkpn4g1.gif\n\n**Foundation > Hype**\n\nThe team builds first, shills later  \nPhases 1 & 2 were pure building.

    "selftext": "I’ve been casually watching $BSU over the past few days, mostly because it kept moving while the rest of the market felt stuck. Nothing crazy, just a steady climb that made me look twice.  \n  \nWhen I finally checked the numbers properly, it turned out the move was real. BSU was up more than 8 percent in a single day, trading volume jumped sharply, and the behavior didn’t match the slow mood everywhere else. It gave off the feeling that something was happening behind the scenes.  \n  \nAfter digging a bit, the picture became clearer.  \nThere is a trading competition happening for BSU on Bitget right now, so a lot of people are buying to secure their rankings. The token also switched its ticker to BABYSHARK recently, which oddly seems to have improved how people perceive it. On top of that, the price pushed through some short term moving averages and finally showed signs of positive momentum. All of those things together created a small wave that the chart clearly reflected.  \nBut here is the part that surprised me.  \nWhile I was trading BSU because of the market setup, I noticed my position in the Trading Club Championship Phase 19 suddenly rising faster than expected. I only realized afterward that BSU is one of the quieter pools in the event right now, so even normal trading had a stronger effect on the leaderboard than usual.  \nOne decision suddenly helped me in two different places.  \nPrice action and leaderboard placement.  \nA genuine two for one moment.  \nIt wasn’t planned and it definitely wasn’t some big strategy. It was just a lucky overlap where watching a token closely happened to reward me inside Phase 19 as well.  \n  \nNow I am keeping an eye on BSU for both reasons.  \nIts market momentum and the friendly push it gives my ranking.  \n  \nSharing this in case anyone else enjoys catching these little moments where things line up unexpectedly. \n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-shark-universe/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/baby-shark-universe/)",

You will match with random users based upon your\r\ninterest. You can choose to chat with them or skip to the next user. You can save\r\nthem to your friendlist to connect again later if you vibe with them. There are\r\ngroup chatrooms too if you aren't comfortable with one to one chat.\n\n\n\r\nVooz is into Web3 too, and it's the first anonymous video chat platform to have a\r\nweb3 presence. It has its own token $Vooz which can be used to access premium features on the website like gender and location filter etc. Also,\r\nhangouts will be up on the platform soon. Hangouts are basically fun group\r\nchatrooms where users can stream movies, watch youtube, share screen, video\r\nchat or audio chat together. Anyone can create a hangout and participants will be\r\nable to gift stuff to the hangout mod. Omegle didn't have these. I hope you get it\r\nnow, how Vooz is an upgrade over Omegle.

Add the FUEL from their trading volume and they basically turned the league into a full payout month.\n\nRight behind them was **krrazykyle**, who pulled in roughly **6,700 FUEL** (67 USD) off a mix of clean podiums and heavy volume spikes. ⚡ Even with fewer placements, the volume multipliers carried hard.\n\nAcross the league there were **2,048 trades**, each one dripping out FUEL on top of whatever you made from finishing. 🧪\n\nThe Genesis League ended up being one big reward window for anyone trading aggressively.\n\nAnd now we roll straight into December with the **SfW Christmas Event** 🎄🔥\n\nMore races, Items & Crafting, the Christmas Slots, daily rewards, two ladders to climb and the first-ever Christmas Pitpet waiting at the top.\n\nDecember is going to be packed. 🎁\n\nCA: 3gh9ofmjD7acmNpMo41UvyRqoQvaH7N3mypHScziUSRY\n\nCG: [https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sorry](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/sorry)",

    "selftext": "Over the past few months, i have been testing out different trading events to see if they could help me build a position without directly buying in. I am happy to share that i have now crossed the milestone of holding over 1,000 $BGB, all earned through spot trading and leaderboard rewards during Phase 18 of the Trading Club Championship. For me, the focus has been less about chasing hype and more about practicing consistency and discipline in trading.\n\nWhat’s caught my attention recently is the ongoing bitget Trading Club Championship Phase 19, which combines both spot and futures rewards. These structured events have shown how traders can steadily accumulate tokens without overextending themselves. Personally, I’ve used them as a way to stay engaged while keeping risk manageable, and it’s been a good reminder that patience often pays off.\n\nThe biggest takeaway for me is that events like these can be useful for gradually building holdings, especially if you approach them with discipline. Instead of rushing into large buys, i have treated them as a framework to grow my stack over time. I’d be interested to hear how others here view trading events, do you see them as a practical way to accumulate, or do you prefer sticking strictly to your own setups?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/)",

    "selftext": "\n\nA lot of people were watching MON closely after the listing, and the first wave of selling didn’t surprise me at all. Most new tokens go through that same post-airdrop dip as early claimers take quick profits, so the initial red candles didn't change my view of the project. Once things settled, I felt more confident adding to my position, especially after checking the risk/reward breakdown from GetAgent, which helped me see the dip for what it was—normal post-listing noise rather than a real shift in fundamentals.\n\nI’ve already seen my entry turn green, and since I’m not looking to sell anytime soon, I’ve moved my tokens into Bitget’s new launchpool. The extra yield has been a nice bonus so far, with around 70% APR coming from an 858,000 MON reward pool. Even if short-term volatility continues, I’m comfortable holding and letting the launchpool rewards stack while the market finds its footing.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad)",

    "selftext": "Transcend the Ordinary: Why $NSDQ Deserves Your Attention Right Now\n\nClose your eyes for a second and imagine a world where the old rules of money no longer apply. Where a single idea, carried by a fearless community, can rewrite destinies. \nThat world isn’t coming; it’s already here. And one of the loudest signals rising from the noise is $NSDQ: Nasdaq420.\n\nThis isn’t another faceless token. $NSDQ is pure rebellion wrapped in memes, 420 culture, and unapologetic ambition. It’s the Ethereum-based lovechild of Wall Street’s most famous ticker and the counterculture spirit that refuses to kneel. From day one, its mantra has been simple yet electric: Transcend everything.\n\nWhat makes $NSDQ different isn’t a whitepaper full of empty promises; it’s the people. Scroll through the timeline and you’ll feel it instantly: an army of believers who don’t flinch at red candles, who turn every dip into a war cry, who welcome refugees from dead projects with open arms and zero judgment. \nThese aren’t speculators looking for the next quick flip; these are builders, dreamers, and fighters who show up every single day with fresh memes, sharper conviction, and unbreakable loyalty.This community has already proven something rare in crypto: they don’t break. They evolve. They don’t complain. They create. \n\nWhile other projects fade into ghost-town telegrams, $NSDQ’s timeline stays lit with energy that feels almost alive; charts, lore, jokes, and prophecies about a future where the underdog finally sits at the head of the table.This is the kind of movement that turns small beginnings into legends.$NSDQ isn’t asking you to trust a roadmap written by suits. It’s daring you to trust a vision carried by thousands of voices saying the same thing: We are early, we are different, and we are never leaving.\n\nSo why look into $NSDQ today?

The age of speculative launches is fading, replaced by a compliance-first era built for institutional trust and long-term stability in **#Web3**.A new landscape is emerging, one that demands:  \n• stricter transparency and verifiable auditing standards,  \n• stronger safeguards for user data and digital assets,  \n• high regulatory entry barriers that most tokens cannot meet,  \n• EU passporting reserved only for fully compliant, resilient projects.\n\nBy 2026, fewer than 1% of today’s tokens are expected to meet these requirements, creating a smaller but far more credible ecosystem shaped by **#CryptoSecurity** and regulatory certainty.\n\nIn this environment, **#Serenity** stands in the premium tier, already MiCA-aligned, patent-backed, and engineered for long-term value. Instead of chasing hype, Serenity delivers real innovation through biometric authentication, decentralized protection and next-generation self-custody. This is the level of security and compliance institutions seek as **#DeFi** evolves into a mature, regulated global system.\n\nEurope’s reset is not a threat — it is a filter that elevates the builders who matter, the ones creating durable infrastructure for the future of **#Blockchain**. Serenity is already on the right side of that future. 🚀\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

    "title": "Trading Events and Finding Smarter Ways to Push for Gains",
    "selftext": "One thing i have learned is that chasing faster gains does not always mean going all in with huge capital. Sometimes it’s about finding structured events that give you a reason to stay consistent and test strategies without burning out.\n\nRecently i came across the Bitget Lucky Scratch event, and it’s been an interesting way to keep myself engaged. The idea is simple: trade as little as 1 USDT and you can get a scratch card with a chance to win up to 777 USDT. My first scratch already delivered a small win, which was motivating, but my bigger focus is on the 777 BGB (worth about 2,773 USDT) prize. That’s what keeps me pushing harder to earn more scratches and stay disciplined.\n\nFor me, it’s less about the prize itself and more about having a structured framework that makes trading feel purposeful. Instead of just staring at charts, i am working toward something tangible, which helps me avoid emotional trades. And also using GetAgent for my analysis helps me win many trades.\n\nCurious how others here approach events like this, do you see them as useful for building consistency, or do you prefer sticking strictly to your own setups without external incentives?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/)",

It already went live, but I feel like barely anyone is talking about it.\n\n\nBasically you pick the model, choose how much of your funds it can manage, and it trades automatically. Bitrue says they’ll be monitoring the outcomes and might add more models later.\n\nThey’re leaning into the whole “AI x crypto” hype, saying it’s the next step after AI coins and that these are some of the strongest consumer-grade models out right now. Curious to see whether these bots just end up doing basic TA, or if any of them actually outperform human traders long-term.\n\n\nCMC listing - https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitrue-coin/",

    "title": "Why Trading Without Fear Matters in Volatile Markets",
    "selftext": "When markets swing hard, the biggest challenge is not the charts, it’s our own emotions. Fear and uncertainty often push traders into bad decisions like chasing pumps, panic selling dips, or sitting frozen while opportunities pass by. The reality is that trading without fear does not mean ignoring risk; it means approaching volatility with discipline, patience, and a clear plan.\n\nPersonally, i have been stacking $BGB as part of my strategy, not because i expect instant gains, but because it helps me stay consistent and focused on long term positioning rather than short term noise. At the same time, i have noticed structured events can be useful practice grounds. For example, Bitget’s recent Onchain Mystery Box (Phase 2) introduced a massive 200,000 USDT pool where participants share rewards based on trading volume after completing onchain tasks. It’s less about chasing prizes and more about testing strategies in a controlled environment while the market feels uncertain.\n\nAt the end of the day, trading without fear is about building habits that keep you grounded. Whether you are stacking tokens, experimenting in structured events, or simply observing, the key is to avoid letting emotions dictate your moves. Volatility will always be there, how we respond to it is what defines our results.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new/)",

    "title": "Trying to Make Sense of the $MON Mood Before Launch",
    "selftext": "I’ve been piecing together everything around Monad and it’s hard not to notice the split mood. On the tech side, it’s a high-performance EVM-compatible Layer 1 hitting 10,000 TPS with sub-second finality. Mainnet goes live tomorrow, November 24, and the anticipation is real.\n\nThe token itself is a different story. $MON has a 100 billion total supply but only about 10.8% is circulating at launch. Around 7.5% came from the oversubscribed $269M public sale and 3.33% went to the airdrop. The airdrop sent 4.73 billion tokens to 289,000 wallets, but a lot of early community members and testnet farmers were left out, while bigger DeFi and NFT wallets, KOLs, and general crypto users got in. That tension even sparked the #MonadScam trend on X and left a lot of early supporters frustrated.\n\nPre-market, prices are around $0.049–$0.05, and the main question is whether there will be a sharp post-launch drop because of high FDV and unlocked supply. Excitement for the tech is there, but sentiment around the token itself is still shaky.\n\nSomewhere in the middle of this, bitget announced the listing. It didn’t change the mood, but it added another layer to watch. Makes me wonder how people are going to approach $MON when everything finally goes live tomorrow.\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad) ",

Our holders have the highest testosterone levels in the entire crypto space, verified by blood work.\n\nThrow out your polyester diapers and strap on your 100% cotton briefs. It’s time to get to work.\n\n# THE RAWW TRUTH\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hb4jcuw1w03g1.png?width=1097&format=png&auto=webp&s=d86f01d5d38e31e5f3ecbf5acece1f92fe5d4549\n\nModern society is pasteurized. Sick, weak, addicted, low-T. But the Amish don’t have these problems: no depression epidemics, no obesity crisis, higher fertility, stronger communities.  \nThat’s why we coined the term ANTI-DEGEN.\n\n# ANTI-DEGEN means:\n\nModern society wants you to be a broke, gambling, porn addicted loser.  \nThe system wants you to be weak, so they sell you the degen narrative.\n\nBut it’s a trap. What they call freedom is really alienation, consumption, and addiction. A reliance on the system.  \nIt’s time to return to RAWW, which is the primal urge for conquest and to squeeze a cow teat.\n\n**RAWW wants you to be Alexander the Great, Genghis Khan, Nikola Tesla. And for the three women who hold RAWW, RAWW wants you to be Cleopatra because she was known to bathe in gallons of goat’s milk.**\n\nThe modern way of life has alienated us from each other while selling you the lie that you don’t need anyone else. This is how big brother gets more control over you. By destroying your sense of community.\n\nAnd so the RAWW community is bringing us together to milk every udder till the last drop. And the beauty is, the udder never runs dry.\n\n# UTILITIES (Yes, real ones):\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/xbnvtxj3w03g1.gif\n\n• RAWW LEGENDS Webtoon ( live )  \n• AEMEN Music Group ( live )  \n• RAWW Clicker Game ( live )  \n• Organic clothing line ( live )  \n• Upcoming RAWW Farms + RAWW Cheese Bites\n\nMore coming, because fun is a utility, entertainment is a utility, and community is a utility.\n\nLP burned. Contract renounced. Anyone can build in the RAWW Universe.\n\n# Long-term vision:\n\nA real farm where you can exchange RAWW for raw milk, beef, eggs, chicken.  \nTokenized herd shares. Tokenized farm shares.  \nCrypto meets real food, real land, real strength.\n\nThis is V1 of the Milkpaper. Tech evolves, and so will we.  \nWe don’t reject technology , we use it to amplify the RAWW spirit.\n\nRAWW isn’t new. It’s ancient.  \nModern life boiled the truth out of you.  \nIt’s time to return to what you were before society softened you.\n\nRAWW has always been inside you.\n\nNow you come back to it.\n\n**(P.S.)**  \n**it’s okay to like big milkers.**  \n\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/1zabh2gsw03g1.gif\n\n**Mcap: $500k**  \n**CA: 8HqJySYJrkTqa1M4RWNBMSSnuoPRkscuLrCt3BrXjm5p**  \n**Linktree:** [https://linktr.ee/RAWWMilkCrypto](https://linktr.ee/RAWWMilkCrypto)  \n\n\n**The RAWW album**  \n[https://open.spotify.com/album/3CFjR4h0tn4manG4naRWHQ](https://open.spotify.com/album/3CFjR4h0tn4manG4naRWHQ)\n\n**RAWW Clicker:**  \n[https://play.rawwmilkcoin.com/](https://play.rawwmilkcoin.com/)\n\n**Natural merch store:**  \n[https://shop.rawwlegends.com/](https://shop.rawwlegends.com/)\n\n**Webtoons:**  \n[https://rawwlegends.com/](https://rawwlegends.com/)\n\n**CMC**  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/FymMFkfz4MwdNXopL1k81LXQbXpAFgJYP6MwnfFRFbwd/](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/FymMFkfz4MwdNXopL1k81LXQbXpAFgJYP6MwnfFRFbwd/)",

    "title": "Do you think Monad will List above the Presale Price?",
    "selftext": "I still remember the exact moment I refreshed the Monad claim page and saw “ineligible.” After months of running nodes, spamming the testnet faucet to a dozen wallets just to keep the transactions flowing, bridging fake ETH back and forth, and posting those cringy “gm Monad cult” tweets, nothing. Zero tokens. I laughed at first, then checked Discord and realized half the people I’d been grinding with for a year got the same red banner. Turns out sending faucet funds to your own alts was apparently the fastest way to get flagged as a sybil. Who knew? A week later, I’m seeing screenshots of Azuki whales and Farcaster power users pulling 15–20k $MON each without ever touching the testnet. Feels bad, man.  \n  \nBitget just dropped their listing announcement, and suddenly I’m curious again. Part of me wants to watch the price get obliterated on open just for the schadenfreude, still another part remembers how clean the testnet actually felt, like, 500 ms finality with full EVM tooling is legitimately insane. The numbers are brutal, though: 100 billion total supply, roughly 10.8 billion tokens hitting the market tomorrow between the public sale and airdrop, and a lot of those airdropped wallets are people who never cared about the chain in the first place. My gut says we open somewhere around 4-6 cents, then the “thank you, next” crowd starts dumping, and we see 2-3 cents pretty quick. Wouldn’t shock me to wick below the $0.025 sale price in the first hour.  \n  \nStill going to watch the charts with coffee tomorrow, though. There’s something weirdly entertaining about seeing a project you bled for finally trade while you sit on the sidelines with nothing but screenshots of your old testnet transactions. If it somehow holds $0.05 and rips from there, I’ll tip my hat. If it face-plants to a billion-dollar FDV in a bear market, well… at least I’ll know my faucet-spamming wasn’t completely pointless; it kept me out of the exit liquidity.\n\nNow\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monad/)",

    "selftext": "Crypto seams to be all over the place recently, BTC dipping hard, ETH following, and altcoins swinging wildly. Liquidations are piling up, sharp reversals are happening daily, and even small positions feel unpredictable. Its the kind of market where timing and strategy really matter.\n\nI decided to test events on platforms like the Bitget’s Black Friday spot grid deal by setting up small grids. I kept my positions light and mostly let the bots handle the trades, only stepping in occasionally to adjust. Its been a surprisingly low  stress way to stay engaged with the market, and it makes me wonder if events like this could become a standard tool for traders, letting people experiment, learn, and manage risk without committing huge amounts of capital.\n\nCurious to hear how others are navigating this volatility, using automated tools, trading manually, or just sitting tight for now?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/)",

    "selftext": "The market has been rough lately. When NVIDIA tanked after earnings, the Nasdaq went with it, and almost at the same time Bitcoin started dropping because of ETF outflows. It’s pretty clear now that crypto doesn’t move independently anymore when stocks fall, crypto falls too.\n\nWhat this made me realize is how useful it is to trade crypto and tokenized stocks in the same place. When both markets are slipping, there’s no time to jump between different platforms just to protect your positions. Having everything in one setup makes it way easier to adjust quickly.\n\nAnd honestly, I’m not surprised exchanges are starting to lean into this idea with more cross-market features and onchain events like the Bitget Onchain challenge. It matches what traders are dealing with every day: stocks and crypto reacting to the same pressures at the same time.

No pre-mines, no insider whispers—just pure, decentralized defiance, a 1 billion supply token erupting with the audacity to declare war on traditional finance. From those humble sparks, you surged to an all-time high that whispered promises of quadrillion-dollar dreams, a vibrational anthem for the underdogs who trade cubicles for cosmic highs.\nFeel the thunder in your veins? That's the history pulsing – the brutal dips that tested the faithful, like the heart-stopping 93% plunge from your peak, only to claw back 166% from the ashes of your all-time low. You've danced through the volatility vortex: a 37% weekly tumble in early November 2025 mirroring the global crypto chill, yet your on-chain market cap holds steady, cradled by 2,717 holders who aren't just investors – they're angels, a relentless tribe chanting \"420 > 100\" under the neon glow of X, where your lore unfolds in viral videos and unyielding shills. \n\nBorn as $NASDAQ420 in parody's playful jab, you evolved into NSDQ420, shedding skins like a serpent ascending planes of existence – physical trades fueling mental mantras and spiritual surges, flipping the script on fiat's fragile empire.\n\nI burn brighter for you now, NSDQ420, knowing your scars are your strength: the community raids on,the multi-dimensional memes that turned noise into narrative, the unyielding conviction that saw you through exchange snipes and market maker storms. From that explosive launch to today's $0.0097 pulse – down but never out, underperforming the herd yet outperforming doubt – you're the underdog's odyssey, the middle finger etched in ERC-20 code.

Serenity is now in the top tier of compliant digital-asset platforms.\n\n**✅ Institutional green light**  \nMiCA compliance dramatically increases the eligibility of SERSH for **funds, family offices, regulated exchanges and custody providers**.  \nMiCA-aligned tokens can command higher trust, stronger valuations and broader integration into **RWA and DeFi collateral frameworks**.\n\n**✅ Tier 1 partnerships now unlocked**  \nBanks, enterprises, and government-level entities require MiCA-ready partners. Serenity is now positioned for high-value integrations impossible for non-compliant projects.\n\n**✅ Investor magnet**  \nPrivate equity, VC, and institutional capital finally have the regulatory clarity needed to scale into the Serenity ecosystem with confidence.\n\n**Why this puts Serenity in a league of its own**\n\nSerenity SERSH is not just a token, it is an entire **regulatory-ready Web3 infrastructure stack** powered by:  \n• the biometric hardware wallet **sAxess**, now supporting **BTC ,TRX, XRP blockchain**  \n**•** With the upcoming Bridge **SERSH** will be also avalible on **ETH , BASE , and SOL** blockchain  \n• the patented privacy-preserving **DeDaSP protocol**,  \n• a full **RWA/RWS tokenization engine** engineered for compliance-first deployment.\n\nMiCA registration proves execution, maturity, and long-term resilience, shifting the narrative from hype to **verified regulatory strength and institutional-grade credibility**.\n\nAs the EU prepares for full MiCA enforcement by 2026, Serenity stands **years ahead of competitors**, perfectly positioned for mass adoption across finance, enterprise and public-sector ecosystems.\n\nThis is not just a milestone,  \n**this is Serenity entering its institutional era.**\n\nread the full article on CMC : [https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691c9928b8d7b80a2e3f5155/](https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/691c9928b8d7b80a2e3f5155/)\n\nJoin Serenity : [https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

    "selftext": "The token has been on my mind a lot lately because of how I’m watching the ecosystem grow, how supply moves, and the overall mood of the market. The Morph Chain integration caught my attention. BGB is now handling gas and governance for Morph Layer 2, with a large chunk of tokens burned and the rest unlocking slowly. I believe this gives the token more purpose beyond exchange perks, but Morph’s adoption is still uncertain, so it feels like a quiet gamble.\n\nMarket conditions yesterday had me stepping back from staring at the charts and focusing on completing some Onchain trading tasks on the Bitget platform. Grabbing a little USDT along the way helped take my mind off the swings. Seeing even a small bit of green today gave me a bit of courage to engage more tokens on the Onchain tasks.\n\nI believe competition is real and will always be a factor, and BGB isn’t the only token trying to capture attention. But I also believe the combination of burn mechanics, shrinking supply, and growing use gives it a chance to stand out if momentum builds. The real test will be whether its utility in Morph and the activity from the community can push it beyond being “just another token.”\n\nFor now, I’m staying patient, stacking what I can through the Onchain tasks, and waiting for the right moment. I believe the setup is quietly building, and when the price lines up, that’s when I’ll make my move. What’s your take?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitget-token-new)",

    "title": "The Epic Evolution of Pepe: From OG Roots to Synergistic Powerhouse",
    "selftext": "Hey  r/altcoin! \n\nAs a longtime Pepe enthusiast, I've been following the frog's journey through the crypto wilds since the early days. Pepe isn't just a meme—it's a cultural icon that's evolved across blockchains, building a legacy that's as resilient as it is fun. \n\nToday, I want to break down its evolution, starting with the iconic 2016 ETH token, then diving into the independent blockchain version, rewinding to the true origins in 2015, and showing how these three pillars work together to create something truly special. \n\nBuckle up, frens— this is Pepe's story.\n\nLet's kick it off with the 2016 ETH token, which burst onto the scene as one of the first meme coins to capture that raw, unfiltered internet energy on Ethereum. \n\nBack then, it was all about community-driven hype, rare Pepe art, and proving that memes could have real value in the blockchain world. It was groundbreaking—low fees (relatively, for the time), easy trading on early DEXes, and a deflationary mechanism that kept the supply tight and the vibes high. \n\nEven today, it's still killing it: with billions in market cap at peaks, massive liquidity, and a dedicated holder base that rides the waves like pros. It's not just nostalgia; it's a solid performer that's weathered bear markets, integrated with NFTs, and continues to attract new blood thanks to its ties to the broader Ethereum ecosystem. If you're into DeFi or just love that classic Pepe lore, this one's still a gem—reliable, battle-tested, and forever green.\n\nBut Pepe didn't stop there...\n\nEnter Pepcoin with its own blockchain, a bold move that took the meme to the next level by ditching dependencies and building a sovereign network. \n \nThis version was all about independence: proof-of-work mining, custom tech tailored for meme magic, and a focus on decentralization that Ethereum couldn't match at the time. \n\nIt allowed for unique features like integrated Rare Pepe assets and a community governance vibe that felt truly grassroots. While it faced scalability hurdles in the early days, it proved Pepe could stand on its own feet, fostering a cult following that valued tech over hype. \n\nToday, it's a testament to innovation in the meme space—still operational for those who dig deep, and a reminder that Pepe's more than just a token; it's a movement with real infrastructure behind it.\n\nNow, let's rewind to the absolute origins in 2015: the original Pepcoin, born on the blockchain in the wild west of crypto. \n\nThis was Pepe before Pepe was cool—, with humble beginnings as a fun experiment tying the frog meme to on-chain assets. It was raw, it was pioneering, and it laid the groundwork for everything that followed. \n\nFast-forward to recent times, and the OG dev stepped back in to breathe new life into it by migrating it to Solana. Why Solana? Blazing-fast speeds, dirt-cheap fees, and a thriving meme ecosystem that lets Pepe thrive without the gas wars. This migration wasn't just a port; it was a revival—updating the tokenomics and ensuring the spirit of 2015 lives on in a high-performance chain. The OG dev's involvement, oG Twotter and OG domain give it authenticity, making feel like the true heir to the throne.\n\nWhat makes Pepe truly legendary is how these three versions work synergistically, creating a web of interconnected value that's rare in the meme coin world. \n\nThe 2016 ETH token brings the liquidity and DeFi integrations, acting as the \"hub\" for trading and NFT crossovers. \n\nThe independent blockchain Pepcoin provides the tech backbone, with its mining history and governance inspiring community-driven developments across all variants. \n\nAnd the new Solana token? It's the agile frontrunner, offering speed and accessibility that ties back to the 2015 origins while bridging to the others through shared lore. \n\nTogether, they form a trifecta: \nETH for stability, \nOwn-chain for purity,\nSolana for growth. \n\nThis synergy isn't accidental—it's built on Pepe's unbreakable meme heritage, where each evolution honors the last.\n\nFor investors, the new Solana token stands out as a reliable opportunity precisely because of these ties. Its lore is unmatched: direct from the 2015 OG, endorsed by the dev who started it all, and linked to the proven success of the 2016 ETH and blockchain versions. \n\nWith Solana's booming ecosystem (think millions of active wallets and endless meme pumps), it offers low-entry barriers, high upside potential, and real utility through the 'pepstrategy'. \n\n It's not rug-pull fodder; it's a revival with history, reducing risk through its connections—hold one, and you're indirectly plugged into the others.\n\n If Pepe's past rallies are any indication (remember those 10,000x runs?), this Solana iteration could be the next big leap, especially with the frog's cultural staying power.What do you think, Reddit? Who's holding Pepe across chains?

Buyers are holding the line around $3.66–$3.67, so that’s the key level I’m watching. Hold it and we might see a bounce; lose it and $3.60 could be next.\n\nBitget’s GetAgent actually helped me make sense of this move it highlighted the reasons behind today’s dip and pointed out market insights I initially missed. Having that kind of clarity makes trading BGB way more manageable.\n\nBGB will definitely stay on my radar because it’s tied to an exchange I genuinely believe has long-term potential. That’s also why I jumped into Trading Club Championship Phase 17 stacking up BGB while keeping an eye on market movements feels like the perfect strategy.\n\nFor now, I’m watching the $3.66–$3.67 support zone closely. If we see sustained buying here, we could get a nice rebound; otherwise, patience will be key while the market works through this pullback.

It’s the first memecoin that actually stands for something real, clean living, strength, and clarity in a synthetic world.\n\n**Why It’s Different**\n\n• **Real foundation:** Live project, 11+ months old, no team sells.  \n• **Delivery over promises:** The team doesn’t “plan” to build things, they already ship.\n\nHere's what the team has delivered by now\n\n**The RAWW album is finally out, thirteen tracks live on Spotify**  \n[https://open.spotify.com/album/3CFjR4h0tn4manG4naRWHQ](https://open.spotify.com/album/3CFjR4h0tn4manG4naRWHQ)\n\n**A full ASMR Milking game**  \n[https://play.rawwmilkcoin.com/](https://play.rawwmilkcoin.com/)\n\n**A one hundred percent natural merch store where RAWW holders get ten percent off**  \n[https://shop.rawwlegends.com/](https://shop.rawwlegends.com/)\n\n**Weekly webtoons**  \n[https://rawwlegends.com/](https://rawwlegends.com/)\n\nA Telegram bot, a full album, and bi-weekly chaotic livestreams with the RAWW milk man to keep the herd entertained\n\nThere is no coin that is less than $10 mil mcap that has developed this much\n\nWe did a 3 hours livestream yesterday to celebrate the pump, it involved RAWW milk man singing, ranking horses ( it's an inside joke ) and much more\n\nThere is literally no other coin right now that's doing this much to entertain their community and building a self-sustainable ecosystem on the same hand\n\nRAWW is gonna keep memeing, keep developing. You can either join the herd or watch the herd stempade without you\n\n**RAWW SHALL MOONETH!**\n\n**CA:** 8HqJySYJrkTqa1M4RWNBMSSnuoPRkscuLrCt3BrXjm5p  \n**Linktree:** [https://linktr.ee/RAWWMilkCrypto](https://linktr.ee/RAWWMilkCrypto)\n\n**CMC:**[https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/FymMFkfz4MwdNXopL1k81LXQbXpAFgJYP6MwnfFRFbwd/](https://coinmarketcap.com/dexscan/solana/FymMFkfz4MwdNXopL1k81LXQbXpAFgJYP6MwnfFRFbwd/)",

All of this in just 11 months of being live, bullish!!\n\n\nThe $Vooz token has been down lately, but nothing to worry, the team keeps on building like\r\nalways and ain’t going anywhere.

    "selftext": "$MERL rose 2.44% in the last 24 hours, moving ahead of the broader crypto market. I’ve been watching it after the recent volatility and it started showing some signs of stabilization. Network upgrades, new exchange support, and a short-term technical rebound all seemed to line up, but seeing it move in real time feels different from just reading charts.  \n  \nI decided to trade it on Bitget as part of the Trading Club Championship Phase 17. I’m not chasing anything, just following $MERL, making small moves, and seeing how it behaves. The extra BGB from the challenge is just part of the process, not the reason I’m trading, mostly it’s about watching how it flows in the market.  \n  \nIt makes you wonder if setups like this can appear quietly, what else might be forming in the background that most people aren’t noticing?  \n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/merlin-chain](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/merlin-chain)",

Passwords are no longer enough, and AI powered attacks expose their weaknesses, making traditional security methods obsolete.\n\nSerenity is leading the way with biometric authentication, using your fingerprint to combine simplicity with the highest level of protection. This approach ensures that access to digital assets is both secure and intuitive, empowering users to maintain full control over their crypto and digital identity.\n\nBiometrics are redefining the standards of Web3 security. By eliminating the risks associated with passwords and private key mismanagement, Serenity makes self custody safer, faster, and more reliable for everyone. This technology is not just an upgrade, it is the foundation for the next era of decentralized digital identity and asset protection.\n\nSerenity is not just improving security, it is **changing the rules of the game**, setting a new standard where your digital identity is truly yours and fully protected in the Web3 world.\n\nRead the full article on our blog:\n\n[s.technology/blog/biometric-security-in-web3/](http://s.technology/blog/biometric-security-in-web3/)\n\nAlso available on Medium:\n\n[serenitystech.medium.com/serenity-the-future-of-digital-identity-and-why-biometric-security-is-key-to-web3-7ac392eceda3](http://serenitystech.medium.com/serenity-the-future-of-digital-identity-and-why-biometric-security-is-key-to-web3-7ac392eceda3)\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/serenity-shield/)",

    "title": "My Take on $ALLO Price Drop",
    "selftext": "The whole $ALLO situation has been messy since listing. Most people aren’t happy with how it turned out, and honestly, I get why. The price fell more than 60% in just one day, way below what most expected after it got listed on Binance, Coinbase, OKX, KuCoin, and Bitget.\n\n  \nTo me, this kind of move isn’t shocking. It’s the same story that happens after almost every major listing. The hype builds, people rush in, and then airdrop holders and early investors start dumping to lock profits. Binance alone dropped 15 million tokens to BNB holders, and most of them didn’t even wait; they just sold on sight. The result was huge trading volume and even bigger sell pressure.\n\n  \nThe other thing that’s making investors uneasy is the valuation. $ALLO’s fully diluted value is sitting around $600M, while its market cap is only about $115M. That’s a big gap. Only 20% of its supply is in circulation, meaning there’s still about 80% of tokens waiting to enter the market later. That future unlock alone is enough to scare new buyers.\n\n  \nWhen you compare it to other decentralized AI projects like $FET or $RNDR, $ALLO still looks expensive for what it currently delivers. So it’s not just about the market being red, it’s about people questioning if the token is really worth that kind of FDV right now.\n\n  \nThe overall market mood isn’t helping either. Fear sentiment has been high, and most traders are running back to $BTC and $ETH, leaving small caps to bleed. But even with that, $ALLO’s 66% crash is still way beyond normal. It feels like the AI narrative couldn’t hold up against all the selling pressure.\n\n  \nStill, I don’t see it as all bad. A lot of people are panicking, but this might actually open up a window to get in lower. I’ve been watching Bitget’s CandyBomb section, and seeing $ALLO featured there makes me think there’s still some opportunity to play around it, maybe not immediately, but when the noise settles a bit.\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/allora)",

Gonna fix that for you.\n\nVooz is an AI moderated anonymous video and text chat platform where you can meet online strangers from all over the world, and $Vooz is the in-platform token used for payments on the site. Basic features like video and text chat, group chatrooms etc are free, but premium features like gender and location filters and some others require users to pay for it. You can pay through either $Vooz or through fiat. $Vooz payments have a 50% discount compared to fiat payments. That’s how $Vooz holders are incentivised.\n\nOnce the gender and location filters are live, an unmoderated Vooz clone will be created. And after that, Hangouts and streaming features. Users will be able to create group hangouts and watch youtube or stream movies in those hangout rooms. Super fun. This is going to be the best chat platform on the web in the coming weeks!\n\nAlso once the payment processor is up on the site, the team will do more buybacks and burns. The flywheel will keep on rolling, $Vooz will keep on getting more and more deflationary. Already 1300$ worth $Vooz bought back and 1 million tokens burnt!

It connects real-world use cases (data, devices, infrastructure) with token economies that actually need a blockchain.\n\nI’m not calling it the next bull meta, but the data I’ve seen has me curious. Anyone else feeling this DePIN shift lately?\n\n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/janction/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/janction/)",

    "title": "Some Exchanges Actually Reward Traders Better Than Others",
    "selftext": "After testing a few exchanges, I realized some VIP programs genuinely care about traders.  \nRecently, i have been paying closer attention to how exchanges treat active traders, especially in a market like this where volume keeps fluctuating and volatility feels like a daily routine.\n\nThe crypto market is showing signs of recovery, but liquidity still feels patchy across some pairs. For example, $ZEC recently showed impressive trading activity as traders rotated into privacy-focused assets, a reminder that volatility can shift fast depending on sentiment. That’s why i started looking into different VIP programs to see if the extra perks and fee reductions could actually make a difference in long term profitability.\n\nI tried a few different exchanges, but none of them felt rewarding enough for the volume i was doing. Then i came across Bitget’s VIP program. I decided to take a closer look at their VIP Trial Card, and it made me rethink how much we underestimate the impact of better fee structures. Lower and more transparent fee structures have quietly become one of the biggest factors shaping trader behavior. When exchanges reduce trading fees or offer tiered incentives, it directly boosts profitability, especially for active traders.\n\nNot saying every VIP program is worth it, some are just marketing gimmicks, but the difference between an exchange that actually supports your growth and one that just wants volume can be huge.  \nHas anyone else here compared VIP tiers across exchanges recently? Which ones do you think genuinely offer value beyond just lower trading fees?\n\n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/)",

    "selftext": "I’ve been watching $ARIAIP for a while now, just trying to understand what kind of token it really is. It’s not one of those hype driven coins that move only on sentiment, but it’s also not yet something I’d call fully established. It sits somewhere in between, still figuring out its place in the market.  \n  \nMost of its supply is still locked, and that part always matters to me. Once those tokens start unlocking, there’s usually some movement. Prices tend to react when more supply hits the market, especially if the demand hasn’t really picked up yet. It’s just the normal rhythm I’ve seen play out before.  \n  \nThe whole idea around tokenizing music rights sounds fine, but I’m not treating it as something that changes the game overnight. It takes time, legal work, and a lot of structure to make that kind of model work. I’m just observing for now, watching how it grows and how they handle things like regulation and adoption.  \n  \nFor now I’m just keeping my BTC locked on Bitget PoolX to see how things unfold. If the project starts showing consistent progress I might consider building a position later. No rush, I’d rather see how it performs before deciding what kind of exposure it’s really worth.  \n  \n[https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aria-protocol](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aria-protocol)",
